# (lines starting with this character are comments)
# if you want to make custom voice packs for SWWM GZ, you need to provide this
# file in the root of the zip/pk3/whatever, wads are not supported
# list the names of your voice types here and don't forget to define your voice
# lines using a similar format to the base game's:

# with the exception of pain/death/grunt sounds, all lines you may want to
# register require a subtitle language string so they can be properly detected,
# but you can set them to an empty string if you don't want text to display.
# also don't forget to add a SWWM_VOICENAME_* language string for each voice
# type so they have a "human-readable" name in the options menu
