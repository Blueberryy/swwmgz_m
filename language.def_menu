"Welcome to your first mission, \cfDemolitionist\c-. I'll be very direct here, the situation is very fucked. Things don't look good at all. Those fucking \cfUAC\c- idiots have done their worst and now we're paying for it. FUCK... THE... UAC... Seriously. If that damn brat \cfKelliher\c- didn't have me blocked I'd be sending him all sorts of shit right now, you can't even begin to imagine HOW fucking pissed I am...\n"
"\n"
"It all happened so fast that... we didn't really have much time to prepare for it. Half of Earth got entirely taken over now. It's all mostly just the western countries, with the epicenter on \cfUnion States\c- territory, where you'll be deployed. What pisses me off the most is that I can't get in touch with the \cfLunar Capital\c-, it's like they're actively ignoring us or something. Fucking hell, it could have been our chance to contact the \cfNukuri\c- and ask for help, but nope, we're on our own. We... have to do our best to fight these damn things, all by ourselves. That's where you come in.\n"
"\n"
"It is your mission to put an end to this, there are people out there fighting, we don't know how many, who still haven't been evacuated. It's \cfHell on Earth\c- thanks to the amazing and great UAC shoving their stinky-ass fingers into what they shouldn't. Do they even know... How many of my friends I've lost... all the thousands, tens of thousands or even more, that just... couldn't make it. \cfWW3\c- was nothing compared to this. It's just... ugh... And the fucker has the BALLS to just go and act like everything's fine and will be fixed soon. I want to punch that smug bastard... damn it.\n"
"\n"
"*sigh*\n"
"\n"
"Enough grieving... it's all about the mission now. I seriously don't have much faith on the UAC's so-called \cf\"problem solver\"\c-, but WE can do it. Me and a couple others have joined up to make this happen, you're going to save those people. It'll be hard, I know, but you can do it, that's why I built you. If there's even a chance that you'll succeed, I want to tell you that I will personally reward you, \cfDemo-chan\c-. I'm not going to give you any details, I want it to be a surprise.\n"
"\n"
"We haven't been able to provide you with all the available equipment, there was no time for that. Instead, be on the lookout for strategically placed supplies along the way (hopefully the demons won't touch the stuff). I know that sounds kind of videogamey, and if I hear you complain you can eat my pants, I wasn't the one who made that decision. Whatever.\n"
"\n"

"Welcome to your second mission, \cfDemolitionist\c-. While things have calmed down over here, we've been able to resume our work on the \cfAkari Project\c-. You know, the important one I've wanted to work on all my life. So far it's been a success, and you'll be the first to take part in the exploration of other worlds. We've scoured the multiverse for all sorts of interesting places, and this one in particular caught our eye. It is called \cfParthoris\c-, it's a realm of magic and elves and stuff, I dig it. Anyway, I hope the ride wasn't too bumpy, we haven't fine-tuned that yet.\n"
"\n"
"Here's the situation: This place was divided in seven kingdoms, and all was goodâ„¢ until some evildoer wizard of sorts popped up and brainwashed everyone. The only ones who resisted were the elves, the \cfSidhe\c- (how do you even pronounce that). I don't like where this is going already, and I would hate to see a repeat of what we went through, so you're here to put a stop to it.\n"
"\n"
"Your objective is a man called \cfD'Sparil\c-. He's a member of a triad of crazy-ass evil sorcerers called the \cfSerpent Riders\c-. Guy's tall, wears red robes, and talks backwards, can't miss him. He commands armies of undead and shit, nothing you can't deal with, I'm sure. First of all, you'll need to make contact with the Sidhe survivors, see if you can gather any more information on where to go and what to do. Maybe once it's all over we can probably form an alliance or something, and hopefully they won't be pissed that we use wooden furniture.\n"
"\n"
"I'm sure, that once you come back you'll want to transfer over to your \cfMaidbot\c- frame again, so I'll be working on a couple \"extensions\" there to make things more... \"fun\", if you catch my drift. Oh, I'm in the mood for something long... and hard... right now, yes...\n"
"\n"
"So... uh... horniness aside, I'm sorry that we couldn't give you all your stuff. I'm taking the blame this time, I think I screwed something up with the deployment and it got scattered all over the place. It's possible that the locals may have moved it around so... good luck finding it all.\n"

"\n"
"Heya, \cfDemo-chan\c-. It's time for another adventure! Remember that wizard you beat up last time? We've tracked down the next big baddie buddy of his, and you're gonna kick his ass too, oh yeah.\n"
"\n"
"Welcome to \cfCronos\c-. This place used to be nice, until that guy came in stomping around with his armies. Like the wizard dude, this fucker even got some of the locals on their side. Your target is called \cfKorax\c-, like the raven, huh, y'know, \"Corvus Corax\"... ah, forget it.\n"
"\n"
"So the thing is, I'd like you to step in and take him out. Do NOT listen to anything he says, as I bet he'll probably try to get to you too. He's big, ugly, and doesn't look much like the type who'd be capable of riding a serpent, so maybe... he's the one who gets a riding... oh wait no, that doesn't sound very... UGH... baaaaad mental image, holy fuck. Where are \cfIbuki\c-'s tiddies when you need 'em, they're the best at making me forget about everything.\n"
"\n"
"I know you'll want a nice reward for this so, here's what I have in mind. How about some more of that \"fun\" we had last time, hm? You, me, maybe \cfIbuki\c- and \cfMaidbot\c- too... and I wonder... if \cfKirin-kun\c- also... hnnn... and then... *heavy breathing*\n"
"\n"
"OK, wow... phew. Saya, focus. No hornyposting on mission statments, not again. Anyway, bad-ish news??? We got a mixup on the ammo stuff and instead we got these weirdass \cf\"Fabricator\"\c- things from that nerdo. They do provide ammo, at least. As usual, your equipment will be strategically placed here and there, since we couldn't just... send you in with ALL of it at once, again. I don't know why nerdo boy insists on doing things like this. Does he really want everything to be so... ugh... videogamey?\n"
