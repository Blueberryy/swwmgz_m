Most of the work here is original, but there are some notable exceptions:
 - Default player voices are edited from the Fallout 4 Japanese dub.
   * Special Thanks to Gargorias for Player Comments and Head Tracking, which was of great help for tracking down all these lines.
 - Many sounds have been mixed and matched and filtered and whatnot from the following games:
   * Fallout New Vegas
   * Fallout 4
   * Unreal
   * Unreal Tournament
   * Unreal Tournament 2004
   * Deus Ex
   * Thief
   * System Shock 2
   * Painkiller
 - This mod uses libeye, by KeksDose. Big thanks.
 - Title theme, "Traumatic State", by Teque (which a lot of people just know as "the AS-Golgotha music").
 - Intermission theme, "Dragony", also by Teque (very comfy music considering the rest of his repertoire).
 - Trailer theme, "Gateways Part II", also by Teque, and Cube (pretty cool track tbh).
 - The anti-BD feature uses art by IOSYS, edited into the Doom palette.
 - The crash handler uses a sound bit from Umineko and a short clip of the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme.
 - Tewi font by lucy (https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font). Modified to add gradients and drop shadow.
