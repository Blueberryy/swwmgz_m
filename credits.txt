Most of the work here is original, but there are some notable exceptions:
 - Default player voices are edited from the Fallout 4 Japanese dub.
 - This mod uses libeye, by KeksDose. Big thanks.
 - Title theme, "Traumatic State", by Teque (which a lot of people just know as "the AS-Golgotha music").
 - The anti-BD feature uses art by IOSYS, edited into the Doom palette.
 - The crash handler uses a sound bit from Umineko and a short clip of the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme.
