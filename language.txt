Since I have very little confidence in those UAC idiots, I have decided to send you up ahead to assist on the fight against the demon invaders that came to Earth, thanks to their very wonderful and very reliable teleportation experiments backfiring, which is something absolutely no one saw coming, oh no, definitely not. It's not like that hasn't happened like... several times now? If Samuel Hayden didn't have me blocked I'd be sending him all sorts of trash right now. Oh I'd love to see his reaction to this...\n"
"\n"
"Anyway, let's get to the point here. Your main objective is to eliminate all hostile forces in the region. There's going to be a hell a of a lot of fighting up ahead, but I know you can do it, that's why I built you. Do this job well and maybe you'll be rewarded when you come back home, who knows. No, Ibuki won't hug you again, I promise, your chassis will be safe. Your reward will actually be something else, but I won't tell you more details, I want it to be a surprise.\n"
"\n"
"By the way, we haven't been able to provide you with all the available equipment, it would've been very expensive. Instead, be on the lookout for strategically placed supplies along the way. If that sounds too videogamey, you can eat my pants, I wasn't the one who made that decision. Whatever.\n"

While scouring the multiverse with our new portal technology we came across this cool little place called Parthoris. It's got elves 'n magic stuff, very fantasy-like setting, I dig it. Anyway I hope the ride wasn't too bumpy, crossing between universes and all.\n"
"\n"
"Here's what's up: We have information that there is some sort of ongoing war between a bunch of elves and some crazy cult. Your objective is to neutralize this cult, preferably also taking out its leader, some sort of wizard dude. They call him D'Sparil and he's part of a triad of big baddies called the \"Serpent Riders\", because they ride dragons or something I guess? Guy's tall, wears red robes, and talks backwards, can't miss him. I'm sure that when you get back you'll want to transfer over to your maidbot body again, so I'll be working on a couple extensions there to make things more... \"fun\", if you catch my drift.\n"
"\n"
"Once again, I'm sorry that we couldn't give you all your stuff. I'm taking the blame this time, I think I screwed something up with the deployment and it got scattered all over the place. It's possible that the locals may have also moved stuff around so... good luck finding it all.\n"

They do provide ammo, at least.\n"
"\n"
"So yeah, you're now in the land of Cronos, more of that cool dark fantasy stuff around. It seems that some old pal of that wizard dude from last time is being a stinky ass here, and we need that sorted out before we can start studying this place in more detail. So there you go, beat the crap outta him! As a reward, we can do some more of \"that\". Just you, me, maybe Ibuki too... hnnn... and then... *heavy breathing*\n"
"\n"
"OK, wow... phew. Saya, focus. No hornyposting on mission statements. Anyway, more details about your target. Evil dragonish-looking dude, deep voice, and also a Serpent Rider, though I can't even begin to understand how he'd ride one. Maybe he's the one that receives the riding... u... ggdfgfhfhdfh... ok, pls no, BAD mental image, UGH.

"Summary: The Deep Impact is a compressed air gun, allegedly meant to be a child's toy. Its maximum pressure allows for deadly blasts of air that could cause severe internal hemorrhaging and crushing of vital organs.\n"
"\n"
"Primary Fire: Quick puffs of compressed air. This pocket of quickly expanding air can push away obstacles in front of the user, or, if aimed at a solid surface, allow the user to boost their jump height. It also deals considerable damage.\n"
"\n"
"Secondary Fire: Compresses all the air into a single shot with very considerable force. This \"air bullet\" is capable of penetrating multiple targets, digging a hole staight through their bodies. Requires a full air tank.\n"
"\n"
"Reloading: The lever on the side must be pulled several times in order to refill the internal air tank. Once at full capacity, a smart mechanism will lock the lever to avoid accidental overfilling.\n"

"\n"
"Summary: A vast world separate from our own, inhabited by creatures that could only be described as \"demons\". This Hell was first discovered through the various interdimensional travel experiments done by Imanaki Corp back in the early 21st century, although the UAC has put a lot of effort into hiding this fact and claiming to be the first to do so instead. Their response to the UAC walking right in and attempting to steal their precious resources has been that of total annihilation. Starting from the first incidents on Mars and its moons, and now a full-fledged invasion of Earth, there is not much hope left for mankind. Unless we do something about it, that is.\n"

"Nationality: Japanese\n"
"Date of Birth: 2074-09-09\n"
"\n"
"Summary: Ibuki is the result of the Red Oni supersoldier program at Akari Labs, commissioned by the US government. Her purpose was to turn around the losing World War 3 that began due to a very badly received tweet from the President of the United States, an event reminiscent of the incident with Iran that the late Donald Trump had started. In a mere three years she was ready, thanks to an accelerated growth process. She's been enhanced to be effectively bulletproof, always standing strong under any circumstance, capable of handling extreme heat and cold, and trained for handling all kinds of weaponry. Much is also said about her personality, or her questionable physical traits such as the ludicrously impractical bust size, all of this which must clearly have been intentionally done by her creator and self-appointed \"mother\", Saya Miyamoto. After the end of the war she's gone through several jobs, crowning in her current one as a world-famous nude model and vlogger.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: In a way, the Demolitionist project could be said to be a more economic alternative to the Red Oni program. Robots are easy to manufacture en-masse, after all.\n"

"Summary: A man who changed entirely after the loss of his older brother in 1987 during a very famous oil rig explosion near the town of Kereshnovka. Nowadays he's pretty much just a mad scientist shut-in who sometimes creates \"toys\" that are hilariously deadly. In 2049 he attempted to \"take over the world\", an event that backfired so hilariously he completely disappeared from the public eye afterwards.\n"

"\n"
"Summary: Saya was born in 1993 to Nana and Ryuji Miyamoto. She has two siblings: An older brother, Taro, and a younger sister, Yui. As a child she already showed interest in science and technology. At the very early age of 13 she graduated in Computer Science at MIT. Her first project was an autonomous house-cleaning robot, which would later evolve into the modern Maidbot. In 2018, due to the immortality inherited from her grandmother, Princess Kaguya Houraisan, she ceased aging. However, thanks to this she has been able to keep working on everything she ever wanted. To this day, there are hundreds of different projects under her name, this includes you, the Demolitionist.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: Saya is often called \"Not-Tomoko\" around the net, due to similarities to the protagonist of a popular 21st century manga series. She is well known for being quite blunt when talking to people, and also for being exaggeratedly flirty around attractive women. Her favourite colour is red, favourite animal is the otter, and favourite dish is pepperoni pizza. She also enjoys drone metal. Likes baggy clothes, refuses to wear skirts, only pants. Uses Arch, favourite editor is vim, favourite programming language is haskell. Her top \"turn-ons\" are well-endowed women, maids, femboys and heterochromia. She doesn't use deodorant or cologne, although people around her remark that her BO is \"kind of nice actually\". Among other hobbies, Saya really enjoys writing. Her first foray into manga, \"My Maid is a Sex Robot\", became successful enough to get an anime adaptation.\n"

"Summary: Founded in 2015 by Thomas Kelliher, as a shell company of the Union Aerospace Armed Forces (UAAF). The UAC's rise to power began in 2025 with its famous Joint Mars Expeditions. Since the creation of \"Mars City\" and the various posts in Phobos and Deimos, the UAC has been effectively working outside of Earth law, which has caused endless controversy. Moreso after securing their position as the largest military body on Earth in the aftermath of World War 3. In recent years, their experiments in teleportation made the news after a critical failure resulted in an invasion from Hell itself, along with the disappearance of the entire moon of Deimos, and eventually resulted in the demons making their way towards Earth. Governments all across the world have their hands full trying to fend off the attackers, but despite the constant bombardment of his accounts on social media, current CEO Samuel Hayden has refused to give any explanation about this incident. The only information provided is that they \"have a man\" that can resolve this.\n"

After settling in, the shop \"americanized\" itself under the current brand of \"Blackmann Arms\", and quickly rose to fame designing all sorts of ingenious weaponry for the allied forces. In current years, the company is run by Hermann E.

During the peak of the \"Ghoul hunt\" in the town, the facility was destroyed by invading forces from an unidentified origin. Their only target seemed to be that facility, as once the task was done, they returned to their homeworld.\n"
