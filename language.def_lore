"\n"
"Summary: Akari Labs, the Fountain of Innovation, was founded in 2010 by Saya and Taro Miyamoto. While initially just a small robot workshop, they quickly grew over time, covering more diverse fields in the process. One of the labs' most popular products are the Maidbots, life-like humanoid assistant bots that can be freely adopted by any household: \"from energetic, workaholic maids that do their job without asking questions, to tender, motherly maids who take special care of you and encourage you to improve your lifestyle\". The labs are also famous for the creation of Ibuki, the \"Red Oni\", a WW3 veteran supersoldier, now turned supermodel, and in recent years, her successor, the Demolitionist.\n"

"Addendum: Akari Labs was one of the sponsors of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Saya's personal Maidbot singing the national anthem was one of the major highlights of the event.";

"Summary: The Anarukon are a race of immortal beings created by a god known as Noskas Kurenai (in their tongue, \"Father of Eternity\"). They are entirely unkillable, able to recover even if burned to ashes. While most of the population is in the Empire of Novoskhana, other groups split off from it following major disagreements with the empire's policies.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: The Anarukon are the humanoid race with the highest ratio of individuals who don't conform to the sex or gender binaries according to a recent census. Approximately 40% of the population falls under the \"intersex\" classification, and only 30% of the total population could be considered \"cisgender\". A study by Mosse Anderken traced this to a mutation in the Anarukon genome that appeared many years after the creation of the empire.\n"

I also met some of her relatives, like this witchy looking lady... her aunt I think? I couldn't stare at her for too long, it made me anxious. T-there was also uhhh... her mom, really hardcore looking badass gutsy warrior mommy, another aunt who apparently likes to go around in a creepy costume and uses a voice changer to sound all evil, she was the most fun to talk to. I also met the GOD in all caps himself, the \"Father of Eternity\"... oh boy the tension when he was looking at me... but it was fine because turns out he's a real softly lol. Ahhh... it was so fun finally getting to meet these people after having only ever read about them, and oh boy don't even get me started on what it's like to be married to one, huhu.

From his fortress in Nevada he frequently broadcasts himself talking about a coming \"apocalyptic event\" that he's been preparing for.\n"
"\n"
"Saya's Note: So, basically, just some crazy, I get it. But see, one of the designs from this guy was made public, and I couldn't help it but try getting my hands on that thing. I just want to see what it's like for you to handle that ballbusting hunk of metal. I've even given you enhancements to more efficiently utilize it.

"Classification: Arms Designer and Manufacturer\n"
"Location: Cologne, Germany\n"
"\n"
"Summary: Founded in 1924 by Daniel Ischer as \"Schwarzmann Exotischwaffen\", an \"exotic weapons\" workshop in Cologne. Their slogan is \"if you can imagine it, we can build it\". Rose to fame when the family escaped to America in 1933. After settling in, the shop \"americanized\" itself under the current brand of \"Blackmann Arms\", and quickly rose to fame designing all sorts of ingenious weaponry for the allied forces. During WW3 they moved back to Germany, where they've stayed to this day. The company is currently run by Hermann E. Ischer, great-great-grandson of the original founder, who has made it a personal goal that as long as any commissioned weapon can hold more than one bullet, it must have a built-in function for shooting everything as quickly as possible.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: A big part of the company's funding comes from Mr. BIG SHOT Industries, which according to reports by Hermann himself, regularly commissions all sorts of ludicrous shotgun designs that no sane man would think of using. Out of all these strictly private commissions, one sole weapon was eventually made public, the \"Wallbuster\", a 25-barrel revolving shotgun.\n"
"\n"
"Saya's Note: I think I cracked the code here... if the company's name references what I think it does... Oh come on. Did the founder seriously intend people to think of his DICK whenever they looked at the massive guns he made? GROSS.";

"\n"
"Summary: Overcharged variant of the Explodium gun. Not only the bullets, but also parts of the weapon, are made of Explodium. Mixed with strawberry-flavoured hard caramel and pop rocks too, which for some reason results in a festival of fireworks.\n"
"\n"
"Primary Fire: Single shots of explosive sweetness. If the direct blast doesn't kill something, the additional crackles and pops might.\n"
"\n"
"Secondary Fire: Explosive reload. The yield is much more extreme so watch out for splash damage. Can only be performed if you have spare mags.\n"
"\n"
"Special: During the first moments of preparing an explosive reload, you can hold primary fire to keep the mag in and instead throw the whole gun as a grenade for even greater damage than just the mag. Can only be performed if you have at least one spare gun and mag.\n"
"\n"
"Reloading: Same as usual. Remember that you can keep one bullet in the chamber.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: Due to the disposable nature of the Candy Gun, up to 4 additional spares can be held in your inventory.\n"
"\n"
"Saya's Note: I don't understand how mixing hard candy with explodium does this, but I still love every single second of it. Ahhh... makes me real nostalgic. How about we go watch some real fireworks after you're done saving the world?";

"Summary: A cluster of pocket worlds connected by strange portals. Historical research says that these were once all part of a much larger world, but some great cataclysm happened and it all got shattered. Fortunately some \"sages\" devised a way to connect the many hubworlds together once again. We've also been informed that there are three major organizations at work here, but they're not friendly at all, since they've allied with a Serpent Rider. You may have to confront their leaders before facing the one pulling the strings.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: The natives are known to enjoy puzzles, sometimes to a sickening degree.\n"
"\n"
"Saya's Note: Yeah yeah, typical dark fantasy stuff, I get it, \"this all used to be a field of daisies before\" and then shit hits the fan. I'm actually quite intrigued about how those portals work, though.\n";

"Summary: Ever since humanity was made aware of the gateway in Sedna connecting the two solar systems, many expeditions have been made to learn more of the worlds in X'Animen (name given by the governing bodies within). One major discovery that not even the natives were aware of, was that of a ruined research facility in the wasteland planet of Sunkaeze, belonging to a defunct company named \"Decade Mechanics\", run by the long-dead mechanical demigod Maester Mekes. Research material, blueprints and even finished, still functioning products have been found within, giving a general idea of what this facility was specialized in. Various groups have successfully recreated items entirely off their original blueprints, some of which have been commercial successes in the military field.\n"

"Summary: The Deep Impact is a compressed air gun, allegedly meant to be a child's toy. Its maximum pressure allows for deadly blasts of air that could cause severe internal hemorrhaging and crushing of vital organs.\n"
"\n"
"Primary Fire: Quick puffs of compressed air. Pushes away enemies and projectiles, while also dealing some damage.\n"
"\n"
"Secondary Fire: Compresses all the air into a single highly destructive shot. This \"air bullet\" is capable of penetrating multiple targets, digging a hole staight through their bodies. Requires a full air tank.\n"
"\n"
"Reloading: The lever on the side must be pulled several times in order to refill the internal air tank. Once at full capacity, a smart mechanism will lock the lever to avoid accidental overfilling.\n"

"Codename: Demolitionist\n"
"Nationality: Japanese\n"
"Date Of Birth: 2148-01-20\n"
"\n"
"Summary: The Demolitionist is a refinement of the former Red Oni supersoldier program, an AI-controlled combat unit capable of efficiently utilizing any weaponry at its disposition. It is equipped with a portable JetBurst Impulsor unit, allowing it to perform rapid mid-air boosts and dashes, it also comes equipped with two Hammerspace containers, for easy access to carried weapons and ammunition, the two, along with a keychain, being attached to a Magnetic Utility Belt. Its AI core is built on the same technology as Akari Labs' maidbots, the Nekuronbot AI framework, provided as a gift of friendship between Saya and Zanaveth II, the current head of Nekuratek. Thanks to this technology, and combined with a CuteEmotion Display, the Demolitionist is barely indistinguishable from a real person in its behaviour and emotional response, which makes interaction with civilians more comforting. The first unit was deployed in June of 2148 on Union States territory in order to combat the demonic invasion brought upon by the UAC's interventions on Hell.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: Many more details are known about the first Demolitionist thanks to a Q&A session livestreamed by Saya Miyamoto. The unit's full name is \"Demo Miyamoto\", as given by Saya herself. They identify as non-binary, and remark that along with they/them, she/her pronouns are also acceptable. Personality-wise, they can be described as \"quite chatty\", fond of joking around and trying to put a smile on people's faces, but also very serious and determined in their desire to protect those in need. Demo also wears a \"Lucky Collar\" as a token of friendship from Saya, though most people remark that it looks like some sort of BDSM accessory.\n"

"Addendum: These people are fond of adventuring and slaying beasts, many clan members having quite a lot of tales to tell of their exploits. Deneva Unissix, older sister of Misa Unissix, is currently one of the most well known warriors, having been the one to finally defeat Mero The Destructor, a mighty, hulking golem built by the Shadow Prince Kuro Noroko who for centuries had spread terror across Ixxeney.\n"

"\n"
"Addendum: The company had also collaborated multiple times with its Nukuri counterpart, Nekuratek. In 2045, they were given access to Nekuratek's research material from an exploration of the ruined Decade Mechanics facility in Sunkaeze.

"\n"
"Secondary Fire: Lobs the shell as a grenade, it will detonate on impact with any surface or object and release its payload in the direction it was facing when shot.\n"

Forx Aeronautics is the #1 supplier of propulsion engines for all types of aircraft, be it commercial jet planes, or even spaceships. The only exception being the UAC, who prefer their own in-house technology. Forx has also adapted his patented jet propulsion systems for other uses, such as in the \"JetBurst Impulsor\", one of the first tuly portable jetpacks, or the \"Rapid Jet Compensator\", a recoil dampening system for high caliber firearms that permits their use outside of heavy, unwieldy power armor.\n"

In a mere three years she was ready, thanks to an accelerated growth process. She's been enhanced to be effectively bulletproof, always standing strong under any circumstance, capable of handling extreme heat and cold, and trained for handling all kinds of weaponry. Despite all this, not long after she was deployed, the US were struck by an orbital strike, this event was known as the \"White Scar\". For years Ibuki wandered the wastelands, until she was finally retrieved by Taro Miyamoto and brought back to Japan.\n"

After all was over, the Nukuri would begin to make themselves at home among us.\n"

Following the death of Zanata I in 1870, the company's leadership was transferred to her granddaughter Zanata II, who decided to further expand into other fields, such as robotics and information technology, and gradually began to cut down on the fabrication of weaponry. Since the fall of the empire, the company is dedicated entirely to robotics and computing, with their old arms manufactory division being split off and led by Zanata II's son Zanaveth I. The last transfer of leadership was to Zanaveth II in 2128.\n"

This happened during a time where a genetic mutation began to surface among the Anarukon people, resulting in a destabilization of the previously stable sex and gender binaries, to which the Empire responded by ordering the execution of any \"deviants\" born, along with their fathers, and anyone who dared protect them.\n"

"Summary: The Nukuri are a snow-skinned humanoid race native to the frozen moon of Nahkami, in the Xathar System (part of the X'Animen Coalition), who came into contact with humans in what's known as the \"Luna Event\". Their civilization has had a long history of war and conflict, something which came to an eventual end following a seventh world war and a massive political and economic reform known as the \"Nos-Kora Ultimatum\". Before this, Nahkami was a ruthless, warmongering empire ruled with an iron fist by the Yathai royal family. Following the reform, emperor Ledora Yathai was forced into exile and the Nukuri Unified Government was created, with Zanata Nekuraku II elected as president. As someone who had suffered the loss of her family and husband in the previous wars, Zanata had been heavily opposed to the decision of attacking humans, and tried her best to make amends with us following the \"White Scar\" incident, but nothing came of it. As of this article's writing, she is no longer involved in politics. The current president of Nahkami is Saya Kowayanau, who is also the gobernor of the state of Saya.\n"

"Addendum: The Nukuri Unified Government describes itself as a communist \"omnicracy\", where each state, each province, each district, elects their own representatives, fractally: everything is effectively voted by all people in the nation. There is no concept of private property, all previous businesses are now publicly owned, however with their founders still managing things. The Nukuri possess a military force, but they generally only serve to defend the nation from external threats.\n"

Having taken hundreds of years to build, it was finally activated in 2018, after which it took control of Russia's missile systems. Its presence on Earth, as a major threat, was what prompted the Nukuri to initiate the \"Luna Event\". Nukuri forces dispatched in 2021 neutralized the AI, however it was found to be impossible to destroy, so it just stood there, floating in the Arctic seas. In 2097, long after the White Scar incident, and with the Nukuri no longer available to defend the planet, an entity called \"Uruk'Anth\" appeared on Earth, announcing himself to be \"God\", and that it was his will for that machine to bring an end to the world, after humanity had proven to no longer be worthy of his blessing. SUSAN was reactivated, this time taking over the weapon sytems of several major world powers. Earth lived in fear for two long scary years, with the AI broadcasting a staggeringly slow countdown to \"World Purification\", until it was somehow deactivated again and destroyed.\n"

Since the creation of \"Mars City\" and the various posts in Phobos and Deimos, the UAC has been effectively working outside of Earth law, which has caused endless controversy. Moreso after securing their position as the largest military body on Earth in the aftermath of World War 3. In recent years, their experiments in teleportation made the news after a critical failure resulted in an invasion from Hell itself, along with the disappearance of the entire moon of Deimos, and eventually resulted in the demons making their way towards Earth. Governments all across the world have their hands full trying to fend off the attackers, but despite the constant bombardment of his accounts on social media, current CEO Ian Kelliher has refused to give any explanation about this incident.

"\n"
"Summary: Misa is the lead arms designer of the entire Unissix family. Starting at a very early age, her fascination with weaponry has always been quite noticeable. Misa is highly skilled in the interpretation of ancient designs, and is thus often tasked with recreating lost technology. This has included the various Artifacts of Nedoshiaan. She is married to Zanaveth Nekuraku II, the leader of Nekuratek, a massive tech giant in the Nukuri homeworld.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: Her impressive skills in crafting could be seen as a way for her to compensate for the lack of physical prowess needed to become a Dragonblood warrior like her sister. When she met Zanaveth, who was by then just a student on a trip to learn about other cultures, she immediately became infatuated with her, and requested that they got married the next day. Afterwards, having settled in on Nahkami with her wife, Misa became a big fan of videogames, finding it rather exciting to finally be able to go on adventures of her own, without having to put much physical effort into it.\n"

I could send messages sometimes through the embassy in the Lunar Capital, but those damn bunnies always made it hard. BTW...

"\n"
"Summary: In June of 2073, the President of the United States made some very insulting comments about the Nukuri, who were currently in the middle of their 7th World War. They were not very well received. Many Nukuri previously settled on Earth migrated in protest, the emperor of Nahkami had many things to say, and the ball just kept rolling. In no time, the conflict reached its boiling point, and the Nukuri Empire declared war on the US, ready to launch a direct attack as \"punishment for their insolence\". Ground units were deployed in September of 2074, and thus the war began. There were many loses for both sides, in their attempt to \"slay the beast from within\", however, in just three more years, the entire country had fallen. The president was then given a choice: either publicly apologize for his words against the Nukuri Empire, or watch as the wrath of the Emperor falls upon his people. He rejected this proposition, and all Nukuri forces were ordered to leave the area. Then, it happened: With a blinding flash of light, an orbital strike hit several major US cities, reducing them to ashes. Most people who were indoors at the time survived, the rest were not so lucky.\n"
"\n"
"Addendum: When news broke of what had happened on Earth, protests broke out all over the Nukuri Empire, further fueling the still ongoing WW7. Chaos ensued for almost 30 years, until the founders of the University of Nos-Kora stepped in, and put a stop to the war all by themselves. Their ultimatum was taken very seriously, and thus a massive reform began, starting with the Emperor being forced out into exile, never to be allowed to return. The reform reached its climax in 2108, with the formation of the Nukuri Unified Government. Despite all this, relations with the Nukuri were never truly restored, with the exception of various previously allied countries, such as Scotland and Japan.\n"
"\n"
"Saya's Note: Man, this was one of the darkest moments in history. Really fucks me up thinking about it again, especially after I had learned from Zana-sama how things were on the other side. The Nukuri folks were anything but peaceful back in the day, but only because the guy running the show was a fucking megalomaniac asshole supervillain, like fucking hell, toasting the entire US for a BUNCH OF TWEETS. Practically everyone in there turned on him when it happened. The fucker signed his own death sentence right there. On top of that having those two weirdos step in and just... ENDING the war by themselves. Good lord, I hope I never piss them off.";
