Its magenta tint comes from its various parts having been \"enriched\" with a mixture of \cfExplodium\c-, strawberry-flavoured hard caramel and pop rocks, including the ammunition itself. Somehow, this odd combination has resulted in the weapon's typical explosive yield to become a deadly fireworks show with each shot. Not only that, but the fact that the weapon itself also contains Explodium makes it, on its own, quite dangerous for the user, should they accidentally hit it against something, therefore the gun is quite unpopular among the public, making its price skyrocket.\n\n\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Single shots of explosive sweetness. A direct hit should be lethal on most targets, but if they somehow don't drop dead from that, the additional crackles and pops might do the deed, or spread the damage to nearby targets, too.\n\n\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Perform an \"explosive reload\", just like with a standard Explodium Gun. Note that unlike its weaker counterpart, the yield is much more extreme. It is best practice to always have one spare magazine at the ready for the reload, so you aren't left with an unusable weapon should your throw miss the target.\n\n\cfCombo Fire:\c- During the first moments of preparing an explosive reload, you can opt to, instead, leave the magazine in the gun, armed and ready, then throw the whole weapon as a grenade, for the ultimate destruction. As always, make sure you have a fully loaded spare around, or you'll be left with nothing. Due to this disposable nature, you're allowed to carry up to 4 spares in your inventory.

When the family migrated to America in 1933, in the wake of WW2, the shop \"americanized\" itself under its current name, and quickly rose to fame designing all sorts of ingenious weaponry for the allied forces, and taking all sorts of requests for original designs, their slogan becoming \"if you can imagine it, we can make it\".\n\nBlackmann became quite popular due to not only the swiftness in designing all kinds of odd firearms clients would request, but also some of their own original inventions, such as the \cfSilver Bullet\c- series of ultra-high caliber sniper rifles, or the \cfPuntzer\c- series of firearms designed to \"penetrate any material, no matter how resilient\", thanks to their patented \cfSpin Motion Wedge (SMW)\c- bullet design.\n\nAs of 2148, the company is handled by \cfHermann E. Ischer\c- the great-great-grandson of its founder, who has made it his personal goal that any newly created weapon to come out of their factories capable of holding more than one bullet should have the ability to shoot out everything at once, or as quickly as possible. The man himself is also quite popular on social media due to his status as the world record holder for \"largest eyebrows\", often showing them off or talking in detail about the maintenance of such a thing.\n\nA big part of the company's funding comes from \cfMr. BIG SHOT\c-, who, according to reports by Hermann himself, regularly commissions all sorts of ludicrous shotgun designs that no sane man would ever think of using. Out of all these strictly private designs, one sole weapon was eventually made public, the \cfWallbuster\c-, a 25-barrel revolving shotgun, chambered in 10Ga, and said to be capable of \"cleanly breaching through a barrier of pure lead half a meter thick\".\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfYeah, yeah.

After all was over, the Nukuri would begin to make themselves at home among us.\n\nAddendum: The alliance with the Nukuri provided a major boost in scientific advancements for the human race, thanks to their much more advanced technology becoming available to us.

In 2097, long after the White Scar incident, and with the Nukuri no longer available to defend the planet, an entity called \"Uruk'Anth\" appeared on Earth, announcing himself to be \"God\", and that it was his will for that machine to bring an end to the world, after humanity had proven to no longer be worthy of his blessing.

Knox\c-, \cfAshley\c- is the oldest of three children, the others being \cfAdrian Knox\c-, veteran of both WW1 and WW3, and \cfViola Knox\c-, a witch in training (still as of 2148). She spent most of her childhood in Cornwall, after her mother had to flee due to accusations of witchcraft (which weren't exactly false).\n\nIn 1983, she married \cfFredrik Steiner\c-, the two having a single child, \cfChristopher Knox\c-, in 1989. However, after finding out she was a witch he immediately divorced her, leaving her raising her son all by herself. Despite the hardships they faced, Christopher grew up to become one of the greatest scientific prodigies of the early 21st century.\n\nAshley didn't really stick out much until the early 2000's, when, after many years of training to become a guitarist, she formed her own band with a group of friends (some she had met during her time also studying witchcraft in the offworld magical city of \cfSankaideriha\c-).\n\nHer band, \cfThe Black Rat's Coven\c-, made its debut in 2006, initially composed of \cfAshley\c-, \cfPy Kisun\c- (her brother's girlfriend), \cfWilliam Dusk\c- (Ashley's boyfriend at the time), and, quite notably, the goddess of madness \cfMaruku Sarahabinaku\c-, whom Ashley had somehow managed to befriend. Together they became well known for their very particular blend of Gothic Rock, which some aptly nicknamed \"Witch Music\".\n\nIn 2027, following some undisclosed incident between her and William, the two broke up, and he left the band. Not content with just leaving, he decided to cause further harm by announcing that he had been cheating on her with her own granddaughter, \cfLyra Knox\c-. William was replaced by \cfMykka Psyann\c-, the goddess of lore.\n\nMonths after her breakup, during a concert in Japan, Ashley met \cfYui Miyamoto\c- an avid fan of the band for many years. The two began dating shortly after, and after only a couple days, got married. As Ashley declared during an interview, she regretted not having noticed sooner that she's much happier with women.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfAhhhhhh man... Bless this lesbian, amen.\c-\n\n\cfSeriously tho, Ashley-san is just amazing af, I love her music, I love her... everything. And fucking hell I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOO jealous of Yu-chan, she gets to enjoy those soft witch tiddies anytime she wants, while I have to ask for hugs and sometimes she says no and... fuck. But come on, it's just a hug damn it, I just want to feel the softnessâ„¢, what's wrong with that?\c-\n\n\cfAnyway, horniness aside, the other peeps from her band, cool too, really. Good friends with all of them, well, except the huge one, that Maruku gal... guy?... no idea, really. Barely talks, looks scary... I'd rather stay away. Mykka, however... ho boi, all fucking charm. I actually learned most of what I know about gods and stuff from her. She's always happy to talk for hours and hours about \"lore\", and shows me really cool things she can do with her powers too (she can make candy appear out of nowhere, good shit).\c-\n\n\cfAnd well, I guess there's also the other one, the smol pink girl. We're kinda maybe not really in very good terms because of some dumb comments I made which I honestly regret. Look, in my defense, I had no idea and I'm really REALLY blunt with the shit I say sometimes, I can't help it.

They were not very well received. Many Nukuri previously settled on Earth migrated in protest, the emperor of Nahkami had many things to say, and the ball just kept rolling. In no time, the conflict reached its boiling point, and the Nukuri Empire declared war on the US, ready to launch a direct attack as \"punishment for their insolence\". Ground units were deployed in September of 2074, and thus the war began. There were many loses for both sides, in their attempt to \"slay the beast from within\", however, in just three more years, the entire country had fallen. The president was then given a choice: either publicly apologize for his words against the Nukuri Empire, or watch as the wrath of the Emperor falls upon his people. He rejected this proposition, and all Nukuri forces were ordered to leave the area. Then, it happened: With a blinding flash of light, an orbital strike hit several major US cities, reducing them to ashes. Most people who were indoors at the time survived, the rest were not so lucky.\n\nAddendum: When news broke of what had happened on Earth, protests broke out all over the Nukuri Empire, further fueling the still ongoing WW7. Chaos ensued for almost 30 years, until the founders of the University of Nos-Kora stepped in, and put a stop to the war all by themselves. Their ultimatum was taken very seriously, and thus a massive reform began, starting with the Emperor being forced out into exile, never to be allowed to return. The reform reached its climax in 2108, with the formation of the Nukuri Unified Government. Despite all this, relations with the Nukuri were never truly restored, with the exception of various previously allied countries, such as Scotland and Japan.\n\nSaya's Note: Man, this was one of the darkest moments in history. Really fucks me up thinking about it again, especially after I had learned from Zana-sama how things were on the other side. The Nukuri folks were anything but peaceful back in the day, but only because the guy running the show was a fucking megalomaniac asshole supervillain, like fucking hell, toasting the entire US for a BUNCH OF TWEETS. Practically everyone in there turned on him when it happened. The fucker signed his own death sentence right there. On top of that having those two weirdos step in and just...

Gods are as real as any other person, and no different than one, even. Very physical entities that live out there, and often interact with mortals.\n\nAddendum: There are countless gods and demigods scattered all over the universe, some of them may even live among us, without anyone really noticing.\n\nSaya's Note: Alright so listen here, I did mention this in another entry, but I know for a fact that gods are real and I've even met one once. The drummer from Ashley-san's band, her name's Mykka. She's like, an actual, real god. She showed me her powers... it was like being in a dream... she could do ANYTHING. Then she showed me this huge-ass diagram full of all sorts of crazy names, it was her whole family tree, going all the way back to the beginning of time. She pointed at one name in particular, \"Anakauser\", and said: \"this is the one that protects your world\". We talked for hours about all this stuff...

Historical research says that all these small worlds were once part of a much larger whole, but some unknown \"great cataclysm\" happened thousands of years ago, shattering this world and scattering its many fragments, which could only be rejoined through these portals, the creations of a group of powerful sorcerers known as the \cfFour Sages\c-. Of all of them, currently only the \cfSage of Winter\c- remains, and it's said that once he too passes on, the Ethereal Portals will fade away forever, leaving the many lands of Cronos isolated for all of eternity.\n\nWithin this land, there are three major factions at work, the \cfLegion\c-, the \cfArcanum\c-, and the \cfChurch\c- (really just named that). Once constantly fighting among themselves, they are now all under the control of \cfKorax\c-, the second of the \cfSerpent Riders\c-, and were given enhanced power by him. You may have to take on them and their leaders before you can face the Rider himself pulling the strings, but from your experience in previous missions, it's clear that this won't pose a problem.\n\nHowever, what could actually be problematic, is one very special fact about the people from these lands. Their odd obsession with complicated puzzles and other mechanisms, which will test your patience, many times along your journey. Most of these obnoxious time wasters are said to have been devised by a former associate of \cfD'Sparil\c-, a nobleman known as \cfLord Vilkreath\c-, who may have also been behind some of the contraptions you found back in \cfParthoris\c-. There are rumors that him and another old disciple of the Rider have been scheming to resurrect him. This may require further attention eventually.\n\n\cxSaya's Notes:\c-\n\cfYeah yeah, typical dark fantasy stuff here. Especially the whole thing of a \"great cataclysm\" and all, y'know, \"this all used to be a field of daisies before\" and then shit hits the fan. I've heard that story a million times.\c-\n\n\cfAnyway, there is one thing that really sticks out to me here, and it's those \"Ethereal Portals\". That stuff got me curious, it's like the portals Ashley-san makes, but they're like... more \"stable\"? One of these days we gotta visit that sage guy before he croaks, and ask him about it.\c-\n\n\cfOh yeah also... \"puzzles\"?

Their civilization has had a long history of war and conflict, something which came to an eventual end following a seventh world war and a massive political and economic reform known as the \"Nos-Kora Ultimatum\". Before this, Nahkami was a ruthless, warmongering empire ruled with an iron fist by the Yathai royal family. Following the reform, emperor Ledora Yathai was forced into exile and the Nukuri Unified Government was created, with Zanata Nekuraku II elected as president. As someone who had suffered the loss of her family and husband in the previous wars, Zanata had been heavily opposed to the decision of attacking humans, and tried her best to make amends with us following the \"White Scar\" incident, but nothing came of it. As of this article's writing, she is no longer involved in politics. The current president of Nahkami is Saya Kowayanau, who is also the gobernor of the state of Saya.\n\nAddendum: The Nukuri Unified Government describes itself as a communist \"omnicracy\", where each state, each province, each district, elects their own representatives, fractally: everything is effectively voted by all people in the nation. There is no concept of private property, all previous businesses are now publicly owned, however with their founders still managing things. The Nukuri possess a military force, but they generally only serve to defend the nation from external threats.\n\nSaya's Note: Man... communism that actually works, good shit.
