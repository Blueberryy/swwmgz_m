SWWM_INTERTIP4 = "The Pusher has a chance to slip off your hands on altfire if it doesn't land a hit, however as a ranged attack it may still be effective.";
SWWM_INTERTIP5 = "Spare copies of items will be stashed away in your inventory if they can't be immediately used, this even includes health and armor.";
