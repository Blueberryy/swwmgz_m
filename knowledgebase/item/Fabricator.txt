Designation: Universal Ammo Fabricator
Manufacturer: Reubens C. Karnanaiahmani

Summary: Portable nanofabricators that can build any type of ammunition from scratch. Available in several tiers. The main difference being the total amount of base material provided and the complexity of the ammunition that can be crafted.

Addendum: The highest tier is hard to come by, but it should have enough material for a full supply of all types of ammunition.

Saya's Note: The hell is this, lootboxes?
