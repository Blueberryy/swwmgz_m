Another fancy invention from Cyrus Labs, like those Hammerspace units on your
belt.

They have enough base material inside to automagically turn it into ammo you
need. I have some idea of how this works, but I don't get how he's managed to
make these damn things so efficient.

The fabricators come in various tiers, which has a clear effect on what kinds
of ammunition they can make for you. I swear this sounds like a gacha...
