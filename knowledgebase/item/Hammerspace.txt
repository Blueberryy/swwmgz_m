Designation: Pocket Hammerspace Container
Manufacturer: Reubens C. Karnanaiahmani

Summary: These devices provide the carrier with access to a dedicated off-world storage space, with practically instant deposit and withdraw times.

Addendum: Hammerspace containment must not be used for living things.

Saya's Note: This sounds like something out of a videogame, it's cool, sure, but did that stinky nerd really have to be a stinky nerd and call it "Hammerspace"?
