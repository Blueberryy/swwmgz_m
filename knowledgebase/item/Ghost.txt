It doesn't really have a name so we just went with that. It's some sort of
cloaking device. They found lots of them during the expedition to those ruins,
and apparently actual ghosts too, how interesting.

Cracking this thing open will make you completely invisible to others. Seems
like this works by creating some sort of bubble structure that redirects light.

It only does that with light, so they're still going to hear you while you're
there, keep that in mind.
