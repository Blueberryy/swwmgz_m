Designation: Ragekit
Manufacturer: Akari Labs

Summary: Experimental strengthening device for Demolitionists, doubles movement speed, quarters damage taken, and octuples any melee damage dealt. Adapted from technology obtained from the ruins of the Decade Mechanics facility.

Addendum: While the device is active, your voicebox will emit several screaming sounds.

Saya's Note: The screaming is an unintended side effect that I haven't had the time to fix. Big sorry. That's why this is classified as experimental.
