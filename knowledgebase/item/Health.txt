Designation: Health Geodesics
Manufacturer: Unknown

Summary: Discovered in massive amounts within the alien ruins in Sedna. These artifacts provide healing effects when held tightly against one's chest. It is unknown how this process happens, nevertheless, they have become quite popular back on Earth, although their distribution is tightly controlled by Tach-Engine Technologies, who are still studying the artifacts.

Addendum: The most common shapes for these are a tetrahedron and a cube, the former providing less healing potency than the latter.

Saya's Note: I talked with the guy and you're allowed to use these, and any other things they have, so you're going to see them all over the place during your mission.
