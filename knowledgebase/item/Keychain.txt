Designation: Keychain
Manufacturer: Saya Miyamoto

Summary: A nice keychain for all your keys.

Saya's Note: I put some cute things in there that you might like. There's one of the bomb emoji, another of that silly "butt bots gonna bot" sign that you found so funny, and also a little chibi of me, so you can remember me when I'm not around. Oh, and I also put the trans flag in there, you know, as a little memento of that Q&A stream we did. I really didn't expect you to give that kind of answer, but heh, it does make sense when I think about it, you are built to defend human rights after all.
