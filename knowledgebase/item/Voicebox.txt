Designation: "Loudboi" Voicebox
Manufacturer: Akari Labs

Summary: A lightweight voice synthesizer for AI units. Easy to install and program. Comes with a built-in "robotic" filter for those who prefer that over an awkwardly "too human" sounding voice.

Saya's Note: Ibuki is still amused that I programmed your voicebox to sound like her. It also cracks me up that you've even picked up all her little mannerisms because of it.
