Designation: Companion Lamp
Manufacturer: Sankai Exports Ltd.

Summary: A little souvenir from the island of magic. This lamp will follow you around and light up the way. Can be toggled at will so the limited oil supply can be conserved when necessary.

Addendum: Has a tendency to attract moths, though this can have some utility. The lamp is enchanted to make them hostile to nearby enemies, and when turned off they will immediately attack.

Saya's Note: You know, I wish this thing attracted a certain kind of moth I really like...
