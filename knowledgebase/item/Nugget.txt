Designation: Health/Armor Nuggets
Manufacturer: Unknown

Summary: Small chunks of undetermined materials found in large amounts within a cave system below the ancient ruins in Sedna. It appears that when held tightly in one's grasp, they "melt" into the body and either heal one's wounds or strengthen the natural resistances of their bodies, thus being divided between "Health" and "Armor" Nuggets.

Addendum: Excessive usage of these materials does not appear to carry any risk.

Saya's Note: This is so videogamey, wow...
