Designation: Lucky Collar for Demolitionist
Manufacturer: Saya Miyamoto

Summary: Looks cool, projects a contained protective field around the user that reduces damage received when in danger.

Protection:
 - 75% reduction to all damage when below 10% health.

Addendum: The collar cannot break no matter how much damage you receive.

Saya's Note: I made one for Ibuki too. Looks super cute on both of you tbh.
