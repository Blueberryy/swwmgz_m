Summary: These ancient relics were encountered while exploring some ancient alien ruins found in Sedna. When held tightly against one's chest, it can instantly heal any wounds or afflictions. It also appears to have strong rejuvenating effects, making even the oldest of the old feel like a kid once again. Like with other smaller healing artifacts, the nature of these effects is completely unknown and has baffled scientists for ages.
