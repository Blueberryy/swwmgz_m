Designation: "Eviscerator" High Load Flak Cannon
Manufacturer: Mr. BIG SHOT Industries

Summary: A personal redesign of Trident Defensive Technologies' old Mk2 "Shredder" Flechette Cannon, which saw a rise in popularity thanks to the Liandri Tournaments. This variant is much deadlier and guaranteed to make fine red mist out of any fleshy critter it hits.

Primary Fire: Detonates the shell directly, spreading hot steaming metal in front of the user.

Secondary Fire: Lobs the shell as a grenade, it will detonate on impact with any surface or object and release its payload in the direction it was facing when shot.

Reloading: Since the weapon reloads automatically and its internal ammo box has been linked to your Hammerspace Container, the reload button instead functions as a toggle for different spread modes on the primary fire.

Addendum: The metal fragments shot by this weapon will ricochet all over the place, which makes it very effective for shooting around corners.

Saya's Note: Why is there an "owo" face scribbled on every shell? Who did this? I want answers!
