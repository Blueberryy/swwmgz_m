Designation: Model S-5 Biospark Carbine
Manufacturer: Decade Mechanics

Summary: Ancient energy weapon. Its internal operation is undergoing investigation by Tach-Engine Technologies for potential improvements.

Primary Fire: Small blobs of stabilised energy with slight target-seeking abilities.

Secondary Fire: Concentrated, penetrating beam shot.

Reloading: Releases the loaded charge. If it's at least at 50% it will be thrown into the air and detonated as a massive sphere of pure energy that tracks down nearby targets.

Addendum: If the secondary beam comes in contact with an energy blob it will be detonated with increased damage and range.
