Designation: "Rhino Stopper" Spreadgun
Manufacturer: Blackmann Arms Ltd.

Summary: A small, single-shot break action 10Ga shotgun. Compatible with many types of cartridges.

Primary Fire: Shoots the loaded shell.

Secondary Fire: Selects the next ammo type to be used on reload.

Reloading: Unloads the current shell and loads a new one. If the loaded shell was not spent it will be added back to its ammo pool.

Addendum: While simple in its operation, the constant manual reloading tends to become tiresome quickly for some users. A semi-automatic recoil operated variant of the Spreadgun is currently being tested and may be ready for the public in a couple years, there are still some issues to solve such as frequent jamming.
