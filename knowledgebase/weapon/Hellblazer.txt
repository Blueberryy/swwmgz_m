Designation: Hellfire Cannon Mk3 ("Hellblazer")
Manufacturer: Imanaki Research Corporation

Summary: Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher of simple design. Four types of ammunition are available, all of them powered by highly condensed Argent Energy. Standard grenades are pretty much what anyone would expect, Crackshots burst into a cluster of smaller grenades, Ravagers release hellish flames on a wide area, and last but not least, Warheads devastate everything in a large radius, including yourself if you don't keep your distance.

Primary Fire: Shoots the loaded ammunition with its propulsion armed and ready.

Secondary Fire: Lobs the loaded ammunition unarmed, as a bouncing grenade.

Reloading: The reload button allows you to cycle between the four ammo types.

Addendum: Only a limited number of these are in circulation since the fall of Imanaki Corp.
