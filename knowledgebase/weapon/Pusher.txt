Designation: "Pusher" Microfusion Rotary Hammer
Manufacturer: Tach-Engine Technologies

Summary: A somewhat portable rotary hammer meant for construction work. Contains an internal microfusion battery with an expected lifespan of 10,000 years.

Primary Fire: Normal operation, aim the drill bit at whatever you need to break and hold the trigger.

Secondary Fire: For those cases where you find some real tough material that's hard to break. Twist the secondary trigger until the drill bit has receded to what you feel is the adequate distance, then release for it to strike at the target with full force. WARNING: Inadequate grip strength during this operation may cause the device to slip off, always keep the area clear to prevent collateral damages.
