Designation: "Taste the Sweetness" Candy Gun
Manufacturer: Munch Innovations

Summary: Overcharged variant of the Explodium gun. Not only the bullets, but also parts of the weapon, are made of Explodium. Mixed with strawberry-flavoured hard caramel too, which for some reason results in a festival of fireworks.

Primary Fire: Single shots of explosive sweetness.

Secondary Fire: Explosive reload. The yield is much more extreme so watch out for splash damage.

Tertiary Fire: During the first moments of preparing an explosive reload, you can hold primary fire to keep the mag in and instead throw the whole gun as a grenade for even greater damage than just the mag.

Reloading: Same as usual. Remember that you can keep one bullet in the chamber.

Addendum: Due to the disposable nature of the Candy Gun, up to 4 additional spares can be held in your inventory.

Saya's Note: I don't understand how mixing hard candy with explodium makes these fancy fireworks, but I still love every single second of it.
