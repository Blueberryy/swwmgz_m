Designation: "Taste the Sweetness" Candy Gun
Manufacturer: Munch Innovations

Summary: Overcharged variant of the Explodium gun. Not only the bullets, but also parts of the weapon, are made of Explodium. Mixed with strawberry-flavoured hard caramel too for some reason.

Primary Fire: Single shots of explosive sweetness.

Secondary Fire: Explosive reload. The yield is much more extreme so watch out for splash damage.

Tertiary Fire: Arms the internal explodium charges all over the gun, allowing it to be thrown as a grenade for even greater damage than just throwing the mag.

Reloading: Same as usual. Remember that you can keep one bullet in the chamber.

Addendum: Due to the disposable nature of the Candy Gun, spares can be held in your inventory.

Saya's Note: Don't be a dumb robot and hit anyone with the gun, it'll blow up in your face.
