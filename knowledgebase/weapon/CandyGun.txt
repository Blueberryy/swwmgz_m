Designation: "Taste the Sweetness" Candy Gun
Manufacturer: Munch Innovations

Summary: Highly explosive handgun. Not only the bullets, but also parts of the weapon, are made of Explodium. Mixed with strawberry-flavoured hard caramel too for some reason.

Primary Fire: Single shots of explosive sweetness.

Secondary Fire: Charged shot that empties the entire magazine at lightning-fast speed.

Tertiary Fire: Arms the internal explodium charges all over the gun, allowing it to be thrown as a grenade.

Reloading: The same principle as the Explodium Gun applies here, half-spent mags can be used as grenades too.

Addendum: Due to the disposable nature of the Candy Gun, spares can be held in your inventory.
