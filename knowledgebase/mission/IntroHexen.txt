Welcome to your third mission, Demolitionist.

OK, I fucked this up again, I'm sorry, really. All your stuff got lost again, my bad.

Anyway, I'm hoping you've recovered from Ibuki's hug (again). I really though your body would be able to handle that this time, but god damn she's strong. So yeah, you're now in the land of "Cronos". It seems that some old pal of that wizard dude from last mission is being a stinky ass in here, and we need that sorted out before we can start studying this place.

Apparently he's also a "serpent rider", but looks like one himself... Hm, I wonder if maybe the meaning of "rider" here is something else... ok... fuck... why did I give myself that mental image... Yeah I'm just gonna go, maybe another hour of suffocating between Ibuki's boobs will help me forget that... urp...

Saya out.
