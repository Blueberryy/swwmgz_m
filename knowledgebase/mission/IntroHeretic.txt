Welcome to your second mission, Demolitionist.

I hope the ride wasn't too bumpy, crossing between universes and all. This place is apparently called Parthoris. We have information that there is some sort of ongoing war between a bunch of elves and some crazy cult. Your objective is to neutralize this cult, preferably also taking out its leader, some sort of wizard dude. Tall, red robes, talks backwards, can't miss him.

Once again, I'm sorry that we couldn't give you all your stuff. I'm taking the blame this time, I think I screwed something up with the deployment and it all got scattered all over the place. It's possible that the locals may have also moved stuff around so... good luck finding it all.

Saya out.
