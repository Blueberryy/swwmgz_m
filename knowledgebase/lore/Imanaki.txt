Name: Imanaki Research Corporation
Classification: [CLASSIFIED]
Location: Russia

Summary: The name of a private research facility built in 2004 in the isolated town of Kereshnovka, in northern Siberia. Despite trying to keep all their work secret, a lot of information was leaked by anonymous sources. Imanaki specialized in interdimensional travel. Nothing is known about how this all started or where they got all the technology from, but they would regularly perform explorations of Hell, a great many years before the UAC. During the peak of the "Ghoul hunt" in the town, the facility was destroyed by invading forces from an unidentified origin. Their only target seemed to be that facility, as once the task was done, they returned to their homeworld.

Addendum: There are rumors surrounding the UAC's similar forays into exploring and exploiting Hell, with the potential explanation that they have spied on the company back in their UAAF days while under contract providing armed defense to the facility.

Saya's Note: Of course, the "great and mighty" UAC stole all their shit and claimed that research as their own. They really have no fucking shame.
