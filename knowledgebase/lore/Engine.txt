Name: Tach-Engine Technology Institute
Classification: Technology Conglomerate
Location: Scotland

Summary: Founded in 2014 by J.A. Tachmek-Smith, by then the "richest man in the world". Ever since its inception, the man has spent his fortune in research and development of many innovations for the "betterment of mankind". Fusion energy, improvements in waste recycling, cleaner air, etc. Tach-Engine Technologies is currently the second largest tech company on Earth, and the founder has claimed that he has no intent on "swiping the crown off those people", in reference to current industry titan [NAME REMOVED]. The company has also collaborated multiple times with its Nukuri counterpart, Nekuratek, though much of the knowledge exchanged couldn't be put to use due to the restrictions imposed by the UN after World War 3.

Addendum: Thanks to his contact with Nekuratek, the CEO obtained access to the data retrieved from the exploration of the Decade Mechanics ruins. Shortly after this, he announced the opening a new subdivision dedicated to reproducing the works of Decade Mechanics, thus marking the company's entry into the arms race.

Saya's Note: I had to remove the name of those people so I wouldn't get my butt sued clean off. You can't even imagine what they're like. The UAC is nothing compared to them.
