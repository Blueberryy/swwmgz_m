Full Name: Saya Miyamoto
Nationality: Japanese
Date Of Birth: 1993-03-20

Summary: Saya was born in 1993 to Nana and Ryuji Miyamoto. She has two siblings: An older brother, Taro, and a younger sister, Yui. From a young age she had already begun showing an interest in science and technology. At the very early age of 13 she graduated in Computer Science at MIT. Her first project was an autonomous house-cleaning robot, which would eventually evolve into the modern Maidbot. In 2010, Saya and her older brother Taro founded Akari Labs. In 2018, due to the inherited immortality of her great-grandmother, she ceased aging, however thanks to this she has been able to keep working on everything she ever wanted. To this day, there are several hundreds of different projects under her name, this includes you, the Demolitionist.

Addendum: I tried to be "neutral and objective" here, so I can't even talk about how great my manga is. I wish more people would read it, seriously.

Saya's Note: Oh by the way, I know you're reading this so... go away! You have better things to do, you know.
