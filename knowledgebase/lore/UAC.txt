Name: Union Aerospace Corporation
Classification: Military Conglomerate, Research Foundation
Location: United States, Mars, Jupiter

Summary: The UAC was founded in 2015 by Thomas Kelliher. Initially a shell company for the Union Aerospace Armed Forces (UAAF), the UAC became a full fledged company by 2025 when it finally obtained funding for its famous Joint Mars Expeditions. Since the creation of "Mars City" and the various posts in Phobos and Deimos, the UAC has been effectively working outside of Earth law, which has caused endless controversy for the corporation. Moreso after securing their position as the largest military body in Earth in the aftermath of World War 3. In recent years, their experiments in teleportation made the news after a critical failure resulted in an invasion of hostile forces from the depths of Hell itself, along with the disappearance of the entire moon of Deimos itself, and eventually resulted in demonic invasions throughout Earth itself. Governments all across the world have their hands full trying to fend off the attackers, but despite the constant bombardment of his accounts on social media, current CEO Samuel Hayden has refused to give any explanation about this incident. The only information provided is that they "have a man" that can solve this.

Addendum: Many rumors surround this company. There are accusations of ritualistic practices, brainwashing, propaganda... Pretty much anything you could imagine. Don't get involved with them, especially now, after your creator decided to speak ill of the company.

Saya's Note: Oh they TOTALLY deserve what happened to them, and I hope they get fucking screwed even harder for this blunder. I'm glad I never invested in their shit. Little robot boy can eat my shorts, by the way. His "problem solver" isn't going to fix this mess.
