Name: Forx Aeronautics
Classification: Propulsion Engine Manufacturer
Location: United Kingdom

Summary: Founded by Harold Forx in 2029, this company is credited with singlehandedly rescuing the UK from its long fall into economic ruin after Brexit. Forx Aeronautics is the #1 supplier of propulsion engines for all types of aircraft, be it commercial jet planes, or even spaceships. The only exception being the UAC, who prefer their own in-house technology. Forx has also adapted his patented jet propulsion systems for other uses, such as in the "JetBurst Impulsor", one of the first tuly portable jetpacks, or the "Rapid Jet Compensator", a recoil dampening system for high caliber firearms that permits their use outside of heavy, unwieldy power armor.

Saya's Note: Hey did you hear the story about that one time he tried to mow down an orphanage and the guy who ran it gave him a smack so fucking hard he did a complete 180 and left it alone? I've seen the archived footage like a dozen times and I always lose my shit with that asshole's face when he comes out.
