Full Name: Misa Azadeku Unissix aka "Unissix Bokurou Azadeku"
Nationality: Devanikan
Date Of Birth: 1992-02-29

Summary: Azadeku is the lead weapon and armor designer of the entire Unissix family. Starting at a very early age, her fascination with weponry has always been quite noticeable. Despite a strong fighting spirit, she lacks the physical prowess required to be a warrior, so she's dedicated herself entirely to her craft.

Addendum: Rose to fame on Earth during a visit from Zanaveth II, her wife, who leads Nekuratek, a massive tech giant in the Nukuri homeworld.

Saya's Note: I remember having some chats with her. She's got good taste, and her wife is hot af. I'm still pissy that we haven't been in contact much thanks to those American idiots causing the Nukuri to leave.
