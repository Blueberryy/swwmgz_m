Welcome to your first mission, Demolitionist.

Your main objective is to eliminate all hostile forces in this region. There's
going to be hell of a lot of fighting up ahead, but I know you can do it,
that's why I built you. Do this job well and maybe you'll be rewarded when you
come back home, who knows.

We haven't been able to provide you with all the available equipment. Suppliers
are unable to send all the stuff to you right away, but you may be able to find
little things here and there as you go. If that sounds too videogamey, you can
eat my pants.

Saya out.
