Full Name: Ibuki Miyamoto
Codename: Red Oni
Nationality: Japanese
Date of Birth: 2074-09-09

Summary: Ibuki is the result of the Red Oni supersoldier program at Akari Labs, commissioned by the US government. Her purpose was to turn around the losing World War 3 that began due to a very badly received tweet from the President of the United States, an event reminiscent of the incident with Iran that the late Donald Trump had started. In a mere three years she was ready, thanks to an accelerated growth process. She's been enhanced to be effectively bulletproof, always standing strong under any circumstance, capable of handling extreme heat and cold, and trained for handling all kinds of weaponry. Much is also said about her personality, or her questionable physical traits such as the ludicrously impractical bust size, all of this which must clearly have been intentionally done by her creator and self-appointed "mother", Saya Miyamoto.

Addendum: In a way, the Demolitionist project could be said to be a more economic alternative to the Red Oni program. Robots are easy to manufacture en-masse, after all.

Saya's Note: Why does everyone keep bringing that up? What's the problem with me liking giga-tiddies? Like, seriously... Come on, don't kinkshame me, geez.
