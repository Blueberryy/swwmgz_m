*Swimming in Jizz*:
 - This is where I make all the stuff before beta.
 - It's been over nine months already, still a shorter dev time than my
   previous projects.

*Icarus pls play*:
 - Beta release.
 - Finetuning the basics, rebalances, etc.
 - See if I can add those damn swimming anims.
 - Beg more artists for intermission fanart.
 - Stuff to maybe add during this stage: Explodium Guns akimbo, Quick grenade.
 - Collectables. Froggy Chair was only the beginning.

*Cutie Robutt Adventures*:
 - Going Goldâ„¢.
 - Think about the future. There are lots of things I could do now (see
   FuturePlans.md).
 - Maybe try to do the fancy titlemap now, mod trailer, etc.

*Extra Funtimes*:
 - DLC weapons.

*LODS OF LORE*:
 - Finish writing all those damn side stories.
 - Make 'em fancy, maybe add some lil' art to them.

*Fight for the Front and freedom. Move out!*:
 - Oh boy, Strife support time.
 - Let's get that VN dialogue system going.
 - Voice acting? Maybe not, I'd need people to re-voice all Strife NPCs.
 - Oh god I have to do dialogue sprites for all characters. Maybe I can get
   someone else for the job?

*Funny Fellas*:
 - Monster/decoration replacement packs. All of it modelled and tweaked to fit
   the style and theme of the mod. Expect enhanced enemy behaviour, not gonna
   keep it "vanilla".
 - Porting weapons to Hideous Destructor as a meme.

*At this point I'm just making shit up*:
 - Official comic.
