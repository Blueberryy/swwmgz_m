Designation: Ragekit
Manufacturer: Akari Labs

Summary: Experimental strengthening device for Demolitionists. Doubles movement speed, quarters damage taken, and octuples any melee damage dealt. Adapted from technology obtained from the ruins of the Decade Mechanics facility.

Addendum: While the device is active, you may experience some discomfort, and the desire to scream.

Saya's Note: The screaming is an unintended side effect that I haven't had the time to fix. Big sorry. That's why this is classified as experimental. I know you're worried about it, but trust me, it'll be fine. You'll still be my cute Demo-chan even if you constantly drop F-bombs.
