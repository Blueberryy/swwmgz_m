**Gensokyo** is an isolated pocket of space located somewhere in Japan, which has remained completely hidden from the outside world to this day, much like other spaces of the same nature such as the town of **Kereshnovka** in Siberia, **Neissvilla** in Eastern Europe, or **Eureka** in America. Most of the information we have related to this land came from the research of a young student named **Sumireko Usami**, who had managed to find a way to pass through its barrier safely.

The land of Gensokyo does not have a clear political structure, although it appears that there are some individuals who hold some power over what goes on in it, known as the **Sages of Gensokyo**. One potential reason for the fact this place is isolated from the rest of the world may be for the protection of the rest of the world from the creatures that inhabit it.

Many attempts have been made to communicate with them following the initial research, with no successes to this day but one sole exception: The **Miyamoto family**, who initially came from that land, then migrated outside. As reported by **Saya Miyamoto** on social media, the family often travels across the barrier, in order to visit their distant relative, **Princess Kaguya Houraisan**. Following these reports, many have tried to approach members of the Miyamoto family to ask for further information, but they have refused to talk about the subject.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfBoy, people sure are interested in that place, huh? But they just won't fucking understand, that things have to stay like this. Those are the rules, or some shit. Can't have both worlds mixing up together or whatever, it's what that old hag told me once. Yeah, the one that doesn't act her age and goes around with a buncha cosplayers. I'm pretty sure she's related to Ashley-san in some way, they've got the same exact eyes. But like hell am I going to go and ask her, the way she acts around me creeps me out.\c-
