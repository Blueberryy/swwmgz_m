Name: Gensokyo
Classification: Isolated Enclave
Location: Japan

Summary: Gensokyo is an isolated pocket of space located somewhere in Japan. It is entirely hidden from the outside world, although there are ways to get in and out. It is home to many a mythical creature. Not much else is known about it.

Saya's Note: I've gone there a couple times to visit grandma, it's full of weird people, like this one old hag that's always interested in me for some reason. She goes around with a fox girl and a cat girl.
