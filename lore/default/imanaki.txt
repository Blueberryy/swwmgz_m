The **Imanaki Research Corporation** was founded in 2004 by **Tetsuya Imanaki**, with its main headquarters in the town of **Kereshnovka**, in northern Siberia.

While they attempted to keep all their work a well-guarded secret, a lot of information would frequently be leaked by anonymous sources. It is well known that Imanaki Corp engaged in interdimensional travel experiments, specifically to the realm of **Hell**. Much was studied of that world, and with the knowledge gained of their research, the corporation would then delve into the combination of Demon and Human technology. It was not known exactly how they got the technology for interdimensional travel in the first place, until documents from the **Faculty of Illuminated Nobodies** were discovered in late 2099 showing their collaboration, and that most of this technology was of **Xevetha** origin, just like the **SUSAN** AI.

Following an incident where some of the town's local ghouls attempted to attack the installations, Imanaki Corp contacted the **UAAF** in order to request armed defense. When the man they sent to negotiate their contract arrived at the town, he was murdered on sight by one of the ghouls. This prompted the UAAF to immediately send soldiers to the area, in order to exterminate those creatures, as it seemed that they maybe were more hostile than they expected. This "hunt" for the ghouls started in mid-2007, and lasted for two whole years, as the entirety of the town and its surroundings were thoroughly combed and every single encountered creature was exterminated, except for one.

The very last ghoul they encountered proved to be much more resilient than all the others, taking many lives with it as it caused an immense fire within the Nuskar forest. The locals had warned them that this was no ordinary monster, but something much more powerful that they could never defeat. It took many days to weaken that lone ghoul, and when finally they attempted to go for the killing blow, a man approached the soldiers, and stood between them and the downed beast. He was definitely not one of the locals, and the language he spoke could not be identified by anyone. Despite being ordered to step aside, he did not move, pointing at the soldiers and shouting at them. They eventually decided to open fire on him. This was one of the biggest mistakes humanity would ever make.

That man was none other than **Prince Anthon Anderken**, one of the most important members of **Anarukon** royalty, who had, by sheer chance, come to Earth in order to seize that one specific ghoul, for undetermined reasons, at the same exact moment the hunt had started. After being shot down, the ghoul became enraged, and used the last of its strength to engulf everyone in blazing fire. The roar of this explosion of blinding flame was heard all over the world. None of the soldiers survived, as the whole forest was reduced to ashes in an instant. It is unknown what happened to Anthon or the ghoul, but most would assume they both survived.

After this rather spectacular incident, Imanaki Corp resumed their operations, now freed from the threat of the ghouls, although they faced much criticism from the locals for their decision to destroy what they deemed a "national treasure". This relative peace would not last long, however, as the consequences of the attack on Anthon would eventually catch up to them. In December of 2009, before yet another routine expedition to Hell, their portals were hijacked by an unidentified attacker, and from them, a swarm of Anarukon soldiers sprung forth, annihilating everyone they'd find within the installations and their surroundings. The Imanaki Corp building was completely destroyed, and the Anarukon forces remained in the town for many days, before eventually returning to their world, satisfied with the destruction they had caused in retaliation.

Some time after these events, a small recon team managed to salvage some of the research material and other documents from the ruins, which would later on fall into the hands of the **UAC**.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI've talked about the ghoul hunt stuff in another entry, so I won't go into detail here, but yeah, would you look at that. The "great and mighty" UAC, stealing shit from those people.\c

\cfYou know, when they started talking about delving into teleportation tech, I KNEW. I knew right away that they were using all that shit they stole. Fucking bastards, they even claimed to be "the very first", too.\c-
