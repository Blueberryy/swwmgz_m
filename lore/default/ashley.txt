Full Name: Ashley Knox
Nationality: British
Date Of Birth: 1887-10-31

Summary: Ashley is the oldest of the three children of Yrikha Yanikov and Maxwell A. Knox, the others being Adrian, an experienced soldier and veteran of both WW1 and WW2, and Viola, an apprentice witch. She was born in 1887 in London, but spent most of her childhood in Cornwall after her mother had to flee due to accusations of witchcraft. Ashley is most known for being the lead guitarist and singer of "The Black Rat's Coven", a Gothic Rock band composed entirely of witches that has toured all across the world. She is also a masterful painter and sculptor, with some of her works selling for millions.

Addendum: Shortly after the birth of her only son, Christopher, in 1989, Ashley divorced her then-husband Fredrik Steiner. Many years later, during a concert in Japan in 2027, she met Yui Miyamoto, whom she married only a few days after the fact. Ashley regrets not having noticed sooner that she prefers women.
