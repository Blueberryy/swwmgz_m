The **Puntzer** series of weapons from **Blackmann Arms** are prime examples of the potential of their patented **Spin Motion Wedge (SMW)** perforating ammunition.

The **Puntzer Beta** is a six-barrel single-action top-break revolver, equipped with very robust parts, ideal for fans of fanning.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Slow, accurate shots.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Hold to enter fanning mode, release to disengage. While in this mode, you can press/hold primary to shoot much faster, but with lower accuracy.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Twirl the hell out of the gun, for fun.

\cfReloading:\c- Reloads the gun. Thanks to the rapid reloading system provided by your Hammerspaceâ„¢ Container, you merely need to hold your open palm over the cylinder, the bullets will be loaded automatically.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfAh, the revolver, a very classic gun, made famous by all those american "wild west" movies. But this one's special, oh yes. Those fucking corkscrew bullets are some serious shit, spinning like crazy and drilling through stuff. Hermann-senpai is feeding us with the ".05" types specifically, which are the strongest of them all, and supposedly can drill cleanly through walls and everything. That's going to be fun.\c-
