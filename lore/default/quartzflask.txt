A flask of healing potion, made of fine quartz glass, hence its name. Quite popular in the land of Parthoris. Many adventurers never go without at least a handful of them.

The healing effects of the potion contained within only appear to affect organic matter, so a robot like yourself can't benefit from its use.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfTastes fruity, but goes down bitter, not a fan. Reminds me of the meds I had to take for my fever when I was little, that shit was awful.\c-
