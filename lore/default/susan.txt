Summary: An AI-controlled megastructure dozens of kilometers tall, created by a mysterious Qurensniv group called the "Faculty of Illuminated Nobodies". Having taken hundreds of years to build, it was finally activated in 2018, after which it took control of Russia's missile systems. Its presence on Earth, as a major threat, was what prompted the Nukuri to initiate the "Luna Event". Nukuri forces dispatched in 2021 neutralized the AI, however it was found to be impossible to destroy, so it just stood there, floating in the Arctic seas. In 2097, long after the White Scar incident, and with the Nukuri no longer available to defend the planet, an entity called "Uruk'Anth" appeared on Earth, announcing himself to be "God", and that it was his will for that machine to bring an end to the world, after humanity had proven to no longer be worthy of his blessing. SUSAN was reactivated, this time taking over the weapon sytems of several major world powers. Earth lived in fear for two long scary years, with the AI broadcasting a staggeringly slow countdown to "World Purification", until it was somehow deactivated again and destroyed.

Saya's Note: Like, seriously. "I am God and I say you must die", he goes. Yeah, fuck that guy. No one knows, at all, what the fuck happened the second time. It's a mystery how it just... poofed like that, taking out the guy in the process, too.
