Full Name: Zanaveth Nekuraku II
Nationality: Nukuri
Date Of Birth: 1969-08-10

Summary: Zanaveth II is the CEO of Nekuratek, the largest IT megacorporation in Nahkami, and also the current Minister of Interspecies Relations since the governmental reform of 2108. For years she has been the one link with the Nukuri, bringing us news of all that is happening on their homeworld. She has also been in contact with other races, such as the Devanikans, of which her current wife, Misa Unissix, is one of. The two have a single child: Zanaveth III.

Addendum: Zanaveth II is quite fond of Japanese culture, and frequently tours the country with her wife.

Saya's Note: Oh, she's the sweetest gal I've ever met. That lucky bastard Misa sure scored one hell of a wife. I was also very lucky to have met them both, it's super fun hanging out with them and seeing how absolutely amazed Zana-sama is about everything we come across. She's like a kiddo in a candy shop at times, adorable as heck.
