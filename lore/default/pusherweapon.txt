\cf "Pusher" Microfusion Rotary Hammer\c-
\cxManufacturer:\c-

\cxClassification:\c-
\cf Mining Tool\c-

The **Pusher** is a somewhat portable rotary hammer meant for mining and construction work. Its portability comes in part from the usage of an internal microfusion battery, also courtesy of **Tach-Engine Technologies**, providing enough power for 300 hours of constant use. Tach-Engine Technologies does not hold itself responsible for any misuse of this tool.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Normal operation. Aim the drill bit at whatever you need to break, and hold the upper trigger.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- For those cases where you find some real tough material that's hard to crack. Twist the side handle until the drill bit has receded to what you feel is the adequate distance, then tap the primary trigger for it to strike at the target, with full force.

\cfWARNING:\c- Inadequate grip during secondary operation may cause the tool to slip off, always keep the area clear to prevent collateral damages.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, chainsaws are a staple of "tool turned weapon", we all know this, but what about goddamn jackhammers?\c-

\cfYou know actually, that reminded me of this one bigass blunder from Mixom. Those UAC nerds had requested a shipment of jackhammers to be sent to Mars City once, and these idiots go and send chainsaws instead. That's one hell of a mixup, don't ya think?\c-
