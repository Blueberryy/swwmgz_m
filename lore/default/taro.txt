Full Name: Taro Miyamoto
Nationality: Japanese
Date Of Birth: 1985-10-06

Summary: Born in 1985 to Nana and Ryuji Miyamoto. He is the oldest of three, despite what his looks might show. Taro studied at many prestigious universities across the world, expanding his knowledge of technology. His specialties are Software Engineering and Design. He is a highly skilled programmer proficient in several languages. Taro has made many contributions to several open source projects, including the Linux Kernel.

Addendum: Taro tends to be a bit more serious than his younger sister Saya, and thus generally handles PR for Akari Labs in her stead. He is happily engaged to Elena Yanikov XXI.

Saya's Note: Taro nii-san at times feels like the Tsukkomi to my Boke. Eh, dunno if you'd really get what all that means, just go look it up sometime.
