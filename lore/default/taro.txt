Born in 1985 to **Nana** and **Ryuji Miyamoto**, **Taro** is the oldest of three siblings, despite what his looks might show. As a child, he was rather conflictive, but also notably studious. Having finished high school with excellent grades, he went on to study at many prestigious universities across the world, fueled by the desire to expand his knowledge, especially that of computer technology, which he was infatuated with. Alongside **Saya**, his younger sister, they founded **Akari Labs**, a company that specializes in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, among others. There, Taro's specialties are Software Engineering and Design, and he's also in charge of managing public relations, due to Saya not being "much of a people person" unlike him.

Taro is a highly skilled programmer, proficient in several languages, and has quite a lot of projects to his name, along with many contributions to notable open source projects, including the **Linux Kernel**. He's also a self-proclaimed "culture archivist", noting that he's basically a walking library when it comes to aspects of popular culture that for most are lost to time, thanks to the immortality inherited from his mother, and his strong memory. He's also quite popular online for his rather comedic anime reviews, under the persona of **"The Waifu Wizard"**.

In 2091, Taro was chosen to personally retrieve the **Red Oni**, **Ibuki Miyamoto**, after the events of the **White Scar**. Following the tracking signal of her collar, he easily located her, and was about to take her back to Japan when a young girl approached him. It was **Elena Yanikov XXI**, a scavenger who had befriended Ibuki during her time wandering that scorched wasteland. She asked Taro to bring her along, promising to "be a good girl". These words immediately made him accept her proposition.

Not long after that, the two somehow started dating, eventually getting married in 2097.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHOW IN THE NAME OF FUCK did my absolute loser of a brother get a girlfriend? I just don't understand. God, looking at the article after he's edited it, there's so much in there that's just him showing off, pathetic...\c-

\cfYeah, he's that kinda guy. Acts like he's cool shit but once you get past his "amazing skills and achievements", he's just some asshole on the internet. I mean, I admit I kinda am to, a bit, but he's worse. I'd blame it on the fact he spent way too long on shitty forums.\c-

\cfThough, he's also serious af when he wants. And at times like that he basically becomes the Tsukkomi to my Boke. If you don't know what that means you can go look it up, Demo-chan.\c-
