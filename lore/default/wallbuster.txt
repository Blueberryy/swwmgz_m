Designation: "Wallbuster" Heavy Armor Breaching Shotgun
Manufacturer: Blackmann Arms Ltd., commissioned by Mr. BIG SHOT Industries

Summary: A rather unconventional 25-barrel revolving shotgun. Its internal mechanisms are so overtly complicated that they've been described as "Kraut Deep Space Magic" by some.

Primary Fire: Shoots the barrel at the top.

Secondary Fire: Shoots the 5-barrel group at the top.

Tertiary Fire: Shoots all barrels. With some types of ammunition it is possible to breach reinforced steel doors up to 40cm in thickness.

Reloading: Reloading is performed by pulling the side lever, which allows detaching each individual 5-barrel group. For reloading on the go, a magnetic belt or some other mechanism is recommended. Speed loaders are available for purchase from the Blackmann Arms website, or from authorized distributors.

Addendum: The Demolitionist is equipped with a programmable rapid reload routine in order to make the whole process fast and easy.

Saya's Note: Y'know... that name makes me think of grandma. I mean, if you change the first letter... Oh, do you hear those drums and that guitar? 'cause I sure do... Old Days~ â™ª
