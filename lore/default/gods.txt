Name: Gods
Classification: Exactly that
Location: All over the world

Summary: For as long as man was sapient, religion has always been a thing. Mankind has always wondered if some supreme being created us all. The answer to this question may not be exactly what they expected. Gods are as real as any other person, and no different than one, even. Very physical entities that live out there, and often interact with mortals.

Addendum: There are countless gods and demigods scattered all over the universe, some of them may even live among us, without anyone really noticing.

Saya's Note: Alright so listen here, I did mention this in another entry, but I know for a fact that gods are real and I've even met one once. The drummer from Ashley-san's band, her name's Mykka. She's like, an actual, real god. She showed me her powers... it was like being in a dream... she could do ANYTHING. Then she showed me this huge-ass diagram full of all sorts of crazy names, it was her whole family tree, going all the way back to the beginning of time. She pointed at one name in particular, "Anakauser", and said: "this is the one that protects your world". We talked for hours about all this stuff... There's all sorts of things out there, the universe is much larger and complex than we could ever imagine... my mind was blown right there, and still is now.
