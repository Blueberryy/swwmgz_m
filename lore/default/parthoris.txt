**Parthoris** is one of the various extra-universal worlds that were discovered during the initial stages of **Akari Labs**'s interportal experiments, as part of the **Akari Project**. At its core is a land divided in seven major nations, at a stage of development that could be described as "medieval", although there is a clear presence of magical force. There have, however, been reports of oddly advanced technology in a certain location, far beyond the mainland, which have been identified as the lair of some sort of powerful lich.

When this world was first located, clear signs were found of it having gone through some major battle. The seven nations are all under the control of an individual known as **D'Sparil**, who had taken over them by force with his armies. The exact causes of this are not yet known, but as of the article's writing, the **Demolitionist** has been sent to investigate, and eliminate any threats in the process.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfThere's a buncha stuff in here that's pretty interesting and I'm going to be keeping close watch on the livestream. This is pretty much the first time we're doing a full-on exploration here, you know, so I really REALLY want to see as much as possible of this place.\c-

\cfDunno if you're going to get any close to that one place, this "Lair of Malumax". I'm hella curious about it, the fact that somehow there's one guy with access to modern tech in this medieval fantasy wonderland.\c-
