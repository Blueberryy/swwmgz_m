Name: Parthoris
Classification: Alternate world

Summary: One of the other worlds we've discovered during the initial interportal experiments. This land is divided in seven major nations we don't yet know the name of, and appears to be stuck in some sort of a medieval-ish fantasy type setting, although some of our explorers have reported sights of unusually complex technology in a certain location we haven't been able to approach. As of now there is some hostility in the area what with a bunch of evildoers having taken over by force.

Saya's Note: You are our ambassador here, so I hope you make a good impression. BTW I'm really curious about this "Lair of Malumax" they mentioned that's got hi-tech stuff. Quite out of place for this kind of setting.
