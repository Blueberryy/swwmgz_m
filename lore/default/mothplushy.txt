A lovely handcrafted plush doll of **Mashiro**, the moth girl, for good boys and girls alike. Like all moths, she enjoys the light of a good lamp. If you provide her with the soothing glow of a **Sankai Companion Lamp**, you may get yourself a reliable friend, perhaps a lover. Just, please do be quiet, you may startle her.

We at **Plutoni Incorporated** shall not be held responsible should you find yourself trapped in a time loop with a fine moth girl friend to keep you company.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfThere's a pile of these in my bedroom, you know. One for every time those two have pissed me off. It's scary that they know me so well, seriously.\c-

\cfOh by the way, I've been told that that specific one you're getting, from their stupid gachashit, is potentially cursed. I do NOT like the sound of that... or maybe... What if you actually attract a real moth girl with it? Oh god oh man I want to see that please PLEASE.\c-
