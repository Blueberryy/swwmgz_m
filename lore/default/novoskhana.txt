Name: Undying Eternal Empire of Novoskhana
Classification: Largest empire in existence
Location: Novoskhana

Summary: A tyrannical society where most of the Anarukon reside, ruled by the Eternal Empress Sythana Va Sarkha Daia Mykha Azanth Serei Yanikov I. It is a strict matriarchal society where men live only to serve their wives. Most if not all women born in Novoskhana are raised to be warriors. The Empire has an approximate population of 13 billion, and no one has dared stand up to them.

Addendum: Many groups split out due to disagreements with the Empire's policies, such as the Vexx Sisterhood (now the Eternal Kingdom) and the Rust Empire. This happened during a time where a genetic mutation began to surface among the Anarukon people, resulting in a destabilization of the previously stable sex and gender binaries, to which the Empire responded by ordering the execution of any "deviants" born, along with their fathers, and anyone who dared protect them.

Saya's Note: So... a TERF empire. Wonderful. Just... wonderful.
