Full Name: Maidbot Miyamoto
Nationality: Japanese
Date Of Birth: 2017-07-07

Summary: The first maidbot ever created by Saya, with all others being based on her. Although Maidbot works for the Miyamotos as a servant, she is also considered part of the family, and lives with them, even having her own bedroom. On the side, she's had a successful career as a J-Pop singer and idol, under the nickname of "Meidobot".

Addendum: Maidbot was once fitted into an experimental "combat body" in order to assist the Red Oni in her mission on the US. She proved effective, but was not comfortable with the task and preferred to go back to being a normal girl afterwards.

Saya's Note: You know... all my maidbots, are fully equipped, hm? You know what I mean there... they're fully capable of "loving". Maidbot is no exception herself, and let me tell you... it feels like heaven to do things with her... â™¥
