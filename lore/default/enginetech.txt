Name: Tach-Engine Technology Institute
Classification: Technology Conglomerate
Location: Perth, Scotland

Summary: Founded in 2014 by J.A. Tachmek-Smith, by then the "richest man in the world". Ever since its inception, the man has spent his fortune in research and development of many innovations for the "betterment of mankind". Fusion energy, improvements in waste recycling, cleaner air, etc. Tach-Engine Technologies is currently the second largest tech company on Earth, much to the displeasure of the UAC, who previously held that position, however its undying founder has claimed that he has no intent on "swiping the crown off those people", in reference to current industry titan [NAME REMOVED].

Addendum: The company had also collaborated multiple times with its Nukuri counterpart, Nekuratek. In 2045, they were given access to Nekuratek's research material from an exploration of the ruined Decade Mechanics facility in Sunkaeze. Shortly after this, the founder announced the opening a new subdivision dedicated to reproducing the works of the defunct company, thus marking Tach-Engine's entry into the arms race.

Saya's Note: It's always neat to meet other immortals, especially if they're THOUSANDS of years old, wow. Like, this guy is basically an ancient Egyptian king that got dethroned and cursed with immortality or something, crazy stuff. By the way, I had to remove the name of those people so I wouldn't get my butt sued clean off. You can't even imagine what they're like. The UAC is nothing compared to them.
