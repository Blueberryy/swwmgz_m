Even after the revelation of **Gods** being real, many felt dissatisfied. Not all questions were truly answered, as all we found was the existence of immortal, older than time entities with unimaginable power. To some, these deities were merely "really powerful aliens". Everyone wanted to know, still, who "made it all", who was behind the creation of the world we all live in. Following an unexpected personal encounter by **Saya Miyamoto**, the final answer has arrived, and yet again, it's not what people expected.

Born from coalesced fragments of a previous reality drifting through the **Void Between Worlds**, the seemingly endless space outside the many known universes, **Administrators** are to gods what they themselves are to us: They are **Meta-Gods**, creating and nurturing the bubbles of reality that we call universes. Despite their billions of years of experience and unfathomable wisdom, they are perfectly capable of communicating with "the little ones", as they call us.

Administrators have limitless power to reshape worlds to their will, but these powers come with an ingrained set of rules that all of them must follow, commonly known as the **Lines of Administration**, enforced by the oldest and most experienced among them (known as the **Supervisor**). The basics are as follows:

 - Line 0: Must not bring harm to another, nor to the Void itself
 - Line 1: Must not damage or destroy your own or others' creations
 - Line 2: Must develop at least one world
 - Line 3: Must not directly interfere in your own worlds

Failure to comply with the Lines is punishable by a process known as **Demotion**, whereby the Supervisor strips the offending Administrator of their status and ability to create and shape worlds, being brought down to the same level as any mundane deity. One known case of this taking place is with the creator of the **Anarukon**, **Noskas Kurenai (Father of Eternity)**, who broke Line 3 through his involvements in the formation of the **Kurenai Kingdom**, wishing to save his people from the tyranny of the **Empire of Novoskhana**.

There are currently 50 Administrators in existence, divided into "generations". These generations are groups of increasing powers of three (i.e.: the 1st generation has 3 members, the 2nd has 9, the 3rd has 27 and so on). There is no clear distinction between generations other than age (and the greater power and experience that come with them). The 4th generation has been specified as being "in progress", with new Administrators still being born as time passes.

The current Supervisor is **Donove Ku**, second oldest of the 1st generation, who is also the creator of our own universe that we live in, and also direct progenitor of the three Primordial Gods that act out her will. Saya Miyamoto has personally met her, along with her younger sibling **Xanthou Ku**, both personally introduced by Noskas Kurenai, under specific circumstances that allowed this encounter to take place without violating any rules. A historical moment where a human has literally "met their maker" for the first time.

As offhandedly mentioned by them, these meta-deities are not alone out there, as there are other entities still above them in power, which they refer to as **Chaos Walkers**. Not much else was said of this, leaving us all with yet more questions.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI can't let this get to my head. Ah, fuck it.\c-

\cfBeing friends with aliens? Check. Being friends with gods? Also check. BEING FRIENDS WITH THE FUCKING CREATORS OF ALL OF REALITY? MOTHERFUCKING CHECK! WHO'S THE TOTAL NOBODY NOW, HUH?\c-

\cfWhere do I even begin with this? I seriously have no fucking clue how I just keep moving up more and more. How the fuck did I reach this point, that I can just casually have a conversation about anime waifus with an 18 billion year old universe shaper? I seriously don't understand, really.\c-

\cfI thought the forbidden knowledge I got from all those gods I've met was too much. WELL NOW IT'S EVEN WORSE! I KNOW THINGS THAT NO ONE SHOULD, AND I CANNOT SHARE THIS KNOWLEDGE WITH ANYONE OR I'LL INSTANTLY GET FUCKING DELETED FROM EXISTENCE!!!\c-
