Excitement: Guaranteed

Summary: Can't afford something but still want it? Then how about you get yourself one of these bad boys? Every single instance of this box is guaranteed to drop something worth more than what you've invested, so your money won't go to waste.

Addendum: These boxes come in several tiers, increasing the chances to get even cooler stuff. Be on the lookout for the LEGENDARY GOLDEN CHANCEBOX, as it may give you absolutely wondrous rewards!

Saya's Note: Why did I let them write their own entries? Also what the fuck is this gacha bullshit?
