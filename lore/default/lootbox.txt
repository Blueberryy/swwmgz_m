These boxes are, in addition, divided in several tears, each increasing the chance to obtain even cooler rewards. Be on the lookout, especially, for the **LEGENDARY GOLDEN CHANCEBOX**, as it may give you absolutely wondrous rewards!

\cfOK yeah maybe the moth girls thing is something that I WOULD want, but you get what I mean.\c-

\cf... god I wish moth girls were real\c-
