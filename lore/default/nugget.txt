These so-called **Health and Armor Nuggets** are small chunks of indeterminate composition that were found in large amounts within a cave system below the ancient alien ruins discovered in Sedna during an expedition by the **Tach-Engine Technology Institute**. It appears that, when held tightly in one's grasp, the glowing substance within "melts" into the body, and either heals one's wounds or strengthens their natural resistances. These effects hence resulting in their naming of "Health" and "Armor" nuggets.
Despite many extensive studies performed, no negative side effects have been observed, nor does it seem that there are any risks from excessive usage. One positive side effect, however, is well known, one arising from the "overload" of Armor Nuggets, wherein they will also have an immediate healing effect upon being harmed, as their effects gradually wear off with each hit.

The composition of the Health Nuggets appears similar to that of other healing artifacts found within the ruins, those denoted as **Health Geodesics**. No equivalents in this form have been found for the Armor Nuggets, however.
