The **Loudboi** is a simple and lightweight device for AI units. Easy to install and program, perfect for those building on a budget. There are a wide variety of options for the voice type, along with multiple language support, including Japanese. Those who are rather displeased with the uncannily "too human" default voice synthesis also have the option of enabling a built-in "robot voice" filter.

The **Akari Labs** community offers a variety of custom-made voice packs for this device, too. Please visit our forums for more information.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHeh... Ibuki's so amused that I programmed your voicebox to sound exactly like her. I mean, it fits, a lil' bit, being her little sister in a way, but what amuses ME is that you've somehow picked up all her little mannerisms and stuff. It's like you're a smol Ibuki at times, just without the tiddy.\c-
