Designation: "Deep Impact" Airblaster
Manufacturer: Dr. Locke's Wonderful Toys

Summary: The Deep Impact is a compressed air gun, allegedly meant to be a child's toy. Its maximum pressure allows for deadly blasts of air that could cause severe internal hemorrhaging and crushing of vital organs.

Primary Fire: Quick puffs of compressed air. Pushes away enemies and projectiles, while also dealing some damage.

Secondary Fire: Compresses all the air into a single highly destructive shot. This "air bullet" is capable of penetrating multiple targets, digging a hole staight through their bodies. Requires a full air tank.

Reloading: The lever on the side must be pulled several times in order to refill the internal air tank. Once at full capacity, a smart mechanism will lock the lever to avoid accidental overfilling.

Addendum: It is unclear how exactly this even counts as a toy for children.
