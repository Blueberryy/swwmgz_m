The **Deep Impact**, also known by its former commercial name of **Dr. Locke's Mighty Wolf Breath Airgun**, is a potent compressed air gun, allegedly meant to be a toy for children despite its noted lethality. Its maximum pressure allows for expelling blasts of air that could cause severe internal hemorrhaging and crushing of vital organs. Of the many creations of **Dr. Locke**, this is, however, not the most dangerous currently known. After Locke disappeared following his disastrous attempt at world domination, his toy production company also closed its doors, but most of the products he had created found new life being resold as actual weapons around the net.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Quick puffs of compressed air that will push away enemies and projectiles, dealing only minor damage.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Compresses all the air into a single highly destructive shot, an "air bullet" capable of penetrating multiple targets, dealing lethal damage and blowing them all away. This mode of operation requires a full air tank before it can be used.

\cfReload:\c- Refilling the internal air tank is done by repeatedly pulling on the side lever. You will know the tank is full once a smart mechanism locks it in place, preventing the tank from being overfilled and potentially causing it to explode.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI know you're hella strong, so you better not pull on it too hard. Wait, that sounds wrong... fuck. Forget I said that. Forget you read it, even.\c-
