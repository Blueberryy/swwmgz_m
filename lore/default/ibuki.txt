Full Name: Ibuki Miyamoto
Codename: Red Oni
Nationality: Japanese
Date of Birth: 2074-09-09

Summary: Ibuki is the result of the Red Oni supersoldier program at Akari Labs, commissioned by the US government. Her purpose was to turn the tides on the losing World War 3 that began due to a very badly received tweet from the President of the United States, an event reminiscent of the incident with Iran that the late Donald Trump had started. In a mere three years she was ready, thanks to an accelerated growth process. She's been enhanced to be effectively bulletproof, always standing strong under any circumstance, capable of handling extreme heat and cold, and trained for handling all kinds of weaponry. Despite all this, not long after she was deployed, the US were struck by an orbital strike, this event was known as the "White Scar". For years Ibuki wandered the wastelands, until she was finally retrieved by Taro Miyamoto and brought back to Japan.

Addendum: Much is also said about her personality, or her questionable physical traits such as the ludicrously impractical bust size, all of this which must clearly have been intentionally done by her creator and self-appointed "mother", Saya Miyamoto. After the end of the war she's gone through several jobs, crowning in her current one as a world-famous nude model and vlogger.

Saya's Note: Why does everyone keep bringing that up? What's the problem with me liking giga-tiddies? Like, seriously... Come on, don't kinkshame me, geez.
