**Ibuki** is the result of the **Red Oni** supersoldier program, devised by **Saya Miyamoto** of **Akari Labs**. The existence of this project was kept completely secret until her public reveal in June of 2077. There was much controversy surrounding the Red Oni program, including Saya's personal involvement in it, having accepted a 40 billion USD payment in exchange for it (which was found to be related to Texas having been sold back to Mexico many weeks before). Despite her clear potential and outstanding combat abilities, she was deployed too late, as only moments later, the **White Scar** happened, and with it, the complete devastation of the **United States**.

Many years after the incident, Ibuki was successfully retrieved from the scorched wastelands, having spent a long time as a sort of "roaming mercenary". She returned to Japan in June of 2091, and once settled in, began working odd jobs until finding her true vocation as a nude model.

Having been created from Saya's own DNA, she has effectively inherited the total immortality of the Miyamoto family, on top of this, further enhancements were performed which have given her increased strength and reflexes, along with effectively making her skin bulletproof. Saya has remarked that this last fact means she does not need to wear any clothing.

Additionally citing Saya's rather "interesting" decisions, there is the fact of her particular physical traits beyond those of her strength, including her blatantly obscene bust size, which some deem impractical, much to Saya's disagreement. When asked for further details, she went on a rather lengthy rant on Twitter about the subject of "waifus".

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOK yes sure, I love giga-tiddies. But why does everyone have to call me out for it? Is there really ANYTHING wrong with that, huh? Yeah, thought so.\c-

\cfSure, Ibuki was like, my biggest hornypost ever. I couldn't resist, you know. Fucking... American idiots come to me with a shitload of cash and tell me to make them a supersoldier. Yeah, I suppose they were listening in on all that stuff I had been posting of getting into bioengineering and shit. Boy, they sure were desperate, huh... It was honestly pathetic. BUT, I had an idea there. See... I was thirsty as all fuck, and I thought... what if... I made myself a super strong big tiddy gf, right there?\c-

\cfAaaaaand that's exactly what happened. I spent like three years on that whole thing, growing her in a damn tube. It was my first time doing all of that, but I somehow got lucky and it was a big success. Though... when they began to notice the "abnormality in the subject's breast growth" I started to get nervous. What if they pull the plug on it? I ended up admitting to it being intentional, saying some random shit that came through my mind, like "distraction tactics" or something, I forgot. In the end they let it slide.\c-

\cfOh yeah, did you know? Technically speaking, Ibuki is my clone. Yeah, there may have been some slight modifications, but if my growth hadn't stopped early, who knows, I could have looked that hot one day. Really makes you think huh...\c-

\cfYes, I'm also aware that means I'm engaging in selfcest. So? Is there a problem with that too?\c-
