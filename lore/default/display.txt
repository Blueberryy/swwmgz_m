Designation: CuteEmotion Display
Manufacturer: Akari Labs

Summary: One-sided display designed for use on robots. Located on the head region it can be used to convey simple readable facial expressions selected from an user-configurable library of images that can be associated with any sort of emotion the AI may want to convey, whether it's happy or sad, excited or bored, calm or angered... The possibilities are endless.

Saya's Note: This makes you super cute and huggable (sorry once again for that one time Ibuki crushed you with a hug, btw, I seriously thought your chassis could handle it, but she really is hella strong).
