The **CuteEmotion** is a display device designed for use on robots. It can be used to present a wide variety of facial expressions, selected from a user-configurable library of images, each associated to some particular emotion or sentiment the AI may want to convey, thus enhancing the naturality of social interaction with them. The display is one-sided, allowing it to be aligned with the visual receptors of the robot for a more accurate match with any simulated eye movement.

There are many versions of the device, but the best known is the "Monoglow" model, made popular thanks to its use by the **Demolitionist**.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfY'know, that thing just makes you so cute and huggable... It's, I mean... TOO DAMN CUTE!!!\c-

\cfOh yeah by the way, speaking of hugs, big sorry for that one time, when Ibuki crushed you with one of those bear hugs of her. I seriously thought your chassis could handle it, but holy fuck she's strong enough to bend fucking Almasteel with her bare hands. At least now she knows to hug you like she would any normal person (lucky you, you won't end up with a broken back afterwards).\c-
