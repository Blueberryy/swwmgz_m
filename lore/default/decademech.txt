Name: Decade Mechanics
Classification: Military Research Facility???
Location: Sunkaeze, Xathar outer rim, X'Animen Coalition

Summary: Ever since humanity was made aware of the gateway in Sedna connecting the two solar systems, many expeditions have been made to learn more of the worlds in X'Animen (name given by the governing bodies within). One major discovery that not even the natives were aware of, was that of a ruined research facility in the wasteland planet of Sunkaeze, belonging to a defunct company named "Decade Mechanics", run by the long-dead mechanical demigod Maester Mekes. Research material, blueprints and even finished, still functioning products have been found within, giving a general idea of what this facility was specialized in. Various groups have successfully recreated items entirely off their original blueprints, some of which have been commercial successes in the military field.

Addendum: The ruins are also said to be haunted. Many lives have been lost exploring them, either due to accidents or unidentified "hostile spectral creatures" some have taken to call "angels of death".
