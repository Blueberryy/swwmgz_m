The founder and CEO of **Imanaki Corp**, and also last surviving member of the Imanaki family following the **Onoke Mansion Murders** of 2003. **Tetsuya** had always been a very secretive individual, so nothing is really known of his personal life or history, nor even his appearance.

During the events of the **Ghoul Hunt**, and later the **Hellbound Incident**, he once again avoided death thanks to his absence from the Imanaki Corp installations. However, no one knew where he was exactly, and ever since these events he completely vanished.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfShort article, I know. There really is nothing on this guy, seriously. It's like... he never left any trace of himself other than just... the fact he once existed and was in charge of all that stuff.\c-
