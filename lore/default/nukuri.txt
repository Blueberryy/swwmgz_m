The **Nukuri** are a pale-skinned humanoid race native to **Hebeku**'s frozen moon of **Nahkami**, in the **Xathar System** (part of the **X'Animen Coalition**). They are among the most technologically advanced within the entire Coalition, and are seen as a shining example of progress and dedication, although they've had an extensive history of war and conflict, along with having been involved in notable atrocities. Such a dark past is something they are well aware and ashamed of, ever since the end of their seventh world war and the massive political and economic reform they underwent afterwards.

In the past, Nahkami was a ruthless warmongering empire ruled with an iron fist by the **Yathai** royal family. However, following the reform, and with emperor **Ledora Yathai** being "forced into exile" by the founders of the **University of Nos-Kora**, who led said reform, the **Nukuri Unified Government** was created, with **Zanata Nekuraku II** personally appointed as "transitional" prime minister.

As someone who had suffered the loss of her mother and her husband in the previous wars, Zanata had always been opposed to the empire and its practices, including their decision to attack humanity at the peak of WW7, in what was known as the **White Scar** incident. Following the establishment of the new government, she attempted to make amends with us, but nothing came of it. After this had happened, she stepped down both from her position as prime minister, and also as leader of **Nekuratek**, the company her family has run for many generations. As of this article's writing, the current prime minister of Nahkami, elected by the vast majority, is **Saya Kowayanau**, who is also the governor of the province of **Saya**.

The Nukuri Unified Government can be seen as one of the various examples of successful transitions away from dictatorial regimes to something more open. Its form of government is self-described as a "communist omnicracy", where everyone stands in equal terms and no voice is left unheard. Its method of allowing all its inhabitants to take part in decision-making, the "fractal vote", was widely praised by other neighboring nations. In a way, everything is ultimately decided by all people within the nation, no voice is left unheard. In terms of its economy, there are no concepts of currency, or private ownership. All previous businesses are now publicly owned, however with their founders still holding what's basically a "symbolic" position of leadership, being still involved in their management, under government supervision.

It's also well known that the Nukuri still possess a very strong military force, but they only serve to defend the nation from external threats (something that has rarely happened). In addition, the manufacture and use of weapons is heavily supervised, too.

As of 2148, Nahkami is divided in 17 provinces: Vutai (current capital), Akai, Renko, Namonai, Kobei, Vuzena, Denkou, Kunei, Saya, Vikou, Okuu, Keshou, Nomio, Esevei, Dokaku, Osaka and Asau. There are also two major "off-world" settlements, the space station of Toku and the **Luna Research Institute** on Earth's moon. It should be noted that since the signing of the **White Scar Treaty**, the Luna Institute has remained closed, however.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfMan, talk about a shady history, huh? Recovering from all that and pretty much going and undoing all the shit that happened before (or at least attempting to) takes some guts, though. Honestly, really wish people weren't shit over here and turned them down (why). A premature end to this stupid restriction nonsense would have been so good...\c-

\cfOh yeah, I also get a lot of shit on the internet for talking about it, but yeah, lookie here, more communism that WORKS! But idiots on the internet will be idiots on the internet, anyway.\c-

\cfYou know, I really wish I could live there now. God... imagine, being in there, surrounded by Nukuri cuties... ohohohoho...\c-
