Name: Nukuri
Classification: Alien Race
Location: Nahkami

Summary: The Nukuri are a snow-skinned humanoid race native to the frozen moon of Nahkami, in the Xathar System (part of the X'Animen Coalition), who came into contact with humans in what's known as the "Luna Event". Their civilization has had a long history of war and conflict, something which came to an eventual end following a seventh world war and a massive political and economic reform known as the "Nos-Kora Ultimatum". Before this, Nahkami was a ruthless, warmongering empire ruled with an iron fist by the Yathai royal family. Following the reform, emperor Ledora Yathai was forced into exile and the Nukuri Unified Government was created, with Zanata Nekuraku II elected as president. As someone who had suffered the loss of her family and husband in the previous wars, Zanata had been heavily opposed to the decision of attacking humans, and tried her best to make amends with us following the "White Scar" incident, but nothing came of it. As of this article's writing, she is no longer involved in politics. The current president of Nahkami is Saya Kowayanau, who is also the gobernor of the state of Saya.

Addendum: The Nukuri Unified Government describes itself as a communist "omnicracy", where each state, each province, each district, elects their own representatives, fractally: everything is effectively voted by all people in the nation. There is no concept of private property, all previous businesses are now publicly owned, however with their founders still managing things. The Nukuri possess a military force, but they generally only serve to defend the nation from external threats.

Saya's Note: Man... communism that actually works, good shit. I'd love to live there, surrounded by all sorts of cuties, and spending more time with Misa and Zana-sama... *sigh*
