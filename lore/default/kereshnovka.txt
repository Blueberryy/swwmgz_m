Name: Kereshnovka
Classification: Small City
Location: Siberia

Summary: Kereshnovka is a city located somewhere in the north-central bounds of Siberia. Its exact location cannot be properly pinpointed as it appears to exist within some sort of isolated pocket space that defies the laws of time and space. It is inhabited almost entirely by members of the Qurensniv race, who fled their home planet escaping persecution by a mad dictator. It is also home to Cyrus Enterprises, a famous tech startup.

Addendum: The city's surroundings are inhabited by strange creatures known as "ghouls", who only appear to attack foreigners.

Saya's Note: I know all about the history there, that "mad dictator" the article mentions is nerdo's dad. Old fart got his brains scrambled and went all sorts of crazy and murder-happy, people ran off as fast as they could to avoid being executed for the slightest sign of defiance. How the fuck does that shit even happen and will it happen to nerdo too? I sure hope not...
