**Kereshnovka** is a small region located somewhere in the north-central bounds of Siberia. A more exact location cannot be properly pinpointed, as it appears to exist within some sort of isolated pocket of space that defies the laws of space-time. The region is home to the namesake town of Kereshnovka, which is inhabited almost entirely by members of the **Qurensniv** race who, in 130 BC, had fled their home planet, escaping persecution from mad dictator king **Marc P. Karnanaiahmani**, by then leader of the entire planet of **Karnanaiahma**, in the neighbouring **Xathar system**. Since its foundation, **Reubens C. Karnanaiahmani**, second son of said king and organizer of this mass exodus, has acted as mayor of the town.

The town of Kereshnovka is surrounded by various out-of-place landmarks that make it even more difficult to truly deduce its location. It is delimited by sea at the north, and the closest land to it is the small island of Kopo ("Midnight" in Qurensniv). Extending from the east and south is the large Nuskar forest, which is off limits to foreigners due to the "ghouls" that inhabit it and prey upon those not native to the region. To the west, past a rather sizable mountain ridge, is the Bakie village, a small rural settlement, and to the south/southwest, the arid Yakendere desert.

The town has been host to numerous odd incidents, starting from the **Great Fire of Kereshnovka** in the year 149, when a Qurensniv druid by the name of **Daos Khomax** summoned a large demon into the town that proceeded to burn it all down. Most people thankfully survived, and the demon fled after the local defense forces arrived. The mad druid was executed, but not before claiming that he would return, for he had "bound his immortal soul to the great forest spirits". Days after his burial, his grave was found empty, and ever since then some of the locals have reported seeing a strange hooded figure roam the forests, assuming it to be the late druid, now having become one of the many ghouls.

Other events, in chronological order, include:

\cfThe Killings of "Hynnykka the Great Witch" (1731):\c- A series of gruesome murders across the town, perpetrated by a self-proclaimed "great witch". The culprit always left her signature at the crime scene, along with a hint for the "next target". Despite many attempts, she was never caught. In some cases, the murders would still happen despite all attempts at protecting the target. At the last of the murder scenes, the note she left contained only four words: "now everyone will die". However, nothing happened afterwards.

\cfThe "Spectral Shockwave" (1987):\c- As described by eyewitnesses, a large explosion of teal fire emanating from the abandoned oil rig that **Dr. HÃ¤zel Hoodth** had been using as his personal laboratory. His body was never found, so he was assumed dead. It was reported however that the flames that burst from the location had an odd form reminiscent of the man himself. Much later, others reported seeing a strange "spectre" blinking around random locations across the Nuskar forest, also bearing the same resemblance to the late doctor.

\cfThe Onoke Mansion Murders (2003):\c- A large fire breaks out at the **Onoke Mansion**, where the **Onoke** and **Imanaki** families were currently reunited to celebrate the union of two of their members. All were found brutally murdered, in some odd ritual manner. The only survivor of this whole incident was **Tetsuya Imanaki**, who decided not to attend citing important work reasons.

\cfThe Ghoul Hunt (2007):\c- After a high ranking member of the **UAAF** was murdered by one of the local ghouls following a business visit to the **Imanaki Corp** headquarters, a hunt immediately began for the creatures, despite the cries of "destroying national treasures" from the locals. This hunt lasted for two years, and crowned into the reappearance of the demon that had caused the great fire of 149, who, this time, set ablaze the entire Nuskar forest after being cornered by UAAF soldiers. Following that, all the ghouls were gone, along with the demon itself.

\cfThe Hellbound Incident (2009):\c- During a routine teleportation experiment at Imanaki Corp, their systems were hijacked by an unknown attacker, which altered the destination of their portals. Following this, an army of **Anarukon** warriors went on a rampage all around the facility, eliminating every single Imanaki employee along with all UAAF soldiers placed there in charge of defense. Afterwards, the entire building was destroyed, and the warriors remained there for several days, attacking anyone that approached, until mayor **Reubens C. Karnanaiahmani** managed to contact their leader and request them to leave, as "enough human blood has been shed already".

\cfSUSAN (2018-2021, 2097-2099):\c- In the winter of 2018, a gigantic structure rose from the seas near the town, and began broadcasting a message of "world purification": It announced itself to be **SUSAN**, the **Spear of Unmaking, Severance, Annihilation and Nullification**, created to rid the world of all humans in order to purify it. Following this announcement, Russia's nuclear missile systems were hijacked by it, and it began to emit a countdown of three years until this "purification". This would eventually be stopped in 2021 following the **Luna Event**. SUSAN was successfully neutralized, but could still not be destroyed. It remained inactive until 2097, when it was reactivated again by its very creator, an alien entity called **Uruk'Anth**. This time, the countdown was of two years. Without anyone to stop it this time, all hope was lost, but somehow, in the last minute, something failed, and SUSAN self-destructed, taking the life of its creator with it in the process.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfA whole lot of shit happens in this town, huh? I mean, over at Gensokyo there's even more "incidents" than this, but it's not like outsiders know, huhuhu...\c-

\cfAnyway, quite the backstory for nerdboi, who would have thought that the guy's a prince. PRINCE NERD! Yeah, that's what he is. Boy, I sure hope he doesn't go murdercrazy like his dad did if he ever rises to king (which would make him KING NERD lol).\c-
