**Cronos** is a distant small universe composed of small, self-contained worlds, which are all connected together by quantum gates the locals call **Ethereal Portals**. Historical research says that all these small worlds were once part of a much larger whole, but some unknown "great cataclysm" happened thousands of years ago, shattering this world and scattering its many fragments, which could only be rejoined through these portals, the creations of a group of powerful sorcerers known as the **Four Sages**. Of all of them, currently only the **Sage of Winter** remains, and it's said that once he too passes on, the Ethereal Portals will fade away forever, leaving the many lands of Cronos isolated for all of eternity.

Within this land, there are three major factions at work, the **Legion**, the **Arcanum**, and the **Church** (really just named that). Once constantly fighting among themselves, they are now all under the control of **Korax**, the second of the **Serpent Riders**, and were given enhanced power by him. You may have to take on them and their leaders before you can face the Rider himself pulling the strings, but from your experience in previous missions, it's clear that this won't pose a problem.

However, what could actually be problematic, is one very special fact about the people from these lands. Their odd obsession with complicated puzzles and other mechanisms, which will test your patience, many times along your journey. Most of these obnoxious time wasters are said to have been devised by a former associate of **D'Sparil**, a nobleman known as **Lord Vilkreath**, who may have also been behind some of the contraptions you found back in **Parthoris**. There are rumors that him and another old disciple of the Rider have been scheming to resurrect him. This may require further attention eventually.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah yeah, typical dark fantasy stuff here. Especially the whole thing of a "great cataclysm" and all, y'know, "this all used to be a field of daisies before" and then shit hits the fan. I've heard that story a million times.\c-

\cfAnyway, there is one thing that really sticks out to me here, and it's those "Ethereal Portals". That stuff got me curious, it's like the portals Ashley-san makes, but they're like... more "stable"? One of these days we gotta visit that sage guy before he croaks, and ask him about it.\c-

\cfOh yeah also... "puzzles"? Knowing our audience, chat's going to be flooded with ResidentSleeper every single time, I bet, huhuhuh...\c-
