Name: Cronos
Classification: Collection of worlds

Summary: A cluster of pocket worlds connected by strange portals. Historical research says that these were once all part of a much larger world, but some great cataclysm happened and it all got shattered. Fortunately some "sages" devised a way to connect the many hubworlds together once again. We've also been informed that there are three major organizations at work here, but they're not friendly at all, since they've allied with a Serpent Rider. You may have to confront their leaders before facing the one pulling the strings.

Addendum: The natives are known to enjoy puzzles, sometimes to a sickening degree.

Saya's Note: Yeah yeah, typical dark fantasy stuff, I get it, "this all used to be a field of daisies before" and then shit hits the fan. I'm actually quite intrigued about how those portals work, though.
