A simple magnetic belt, adaptable to any waist size by detaching or attaching segments. The localized magnetic force of each of these belt segments is strong enough to keep any objects firmly attached no matter how much the user moves. It is therefore ideal for you.

No matter the situation, no matter how heated the fight, you will never lose the grip on very important items, such as your keychain or the **Hammerspaceâ„¢** containers at each side, containing your weapons, ammo and others. In addition to all this, the belt is also quite useful to ease the reload process of some weapons (at least those with metalic components in their magazines).
