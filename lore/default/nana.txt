Full Name: Nana Miyamoto
Nationality: Japanese
Date Of Birth: 1907-07-07

Summary: Nana was born in Gensokyo as the sole daughter of Kaguya Houraisan, former princess of the Lunar Capital. Due to the effects of the Hourai elixir she inherited her parents' immortality, which would further spread to her own children. It is unclear who her other parent is, but most point at Fujiwara no Mokou, Kaguya's long-time rival. During the 60's, Nana met a young Ryuji Miyamoto, who had fled the Human Village and made his way into Eientei. They became close friends and the young boy made a promise to marry her when he grew up, this came to happen in 1973, with both of them leaving Gensokyo to form a family of their own.

Addendum: Nana has a wide variety of hobbies, including painting, woodworking, cooking and various martial arts. She has also appeared in many talk shows over the years, due to her fame as a descendant of Lunarian royalty.

Saya's Note: You haven't met her yet, Demo-chan, but I'm sure she'll like you. Don't be put off by how scary she looks, she's nice and kind and is definitely not going to perform CBT on the nearest guy, unlike Kaguya-obaasan.

Saya's Note: Okaa-san is so happy that you're out there doing good work. It was nice to see that she likes you. I did tell you, after all. By the way I did see that, you know, when she hugged you, I saw it, yes. She hasn't really tried to see other guys after dad was gone... But I think that maybe... she likes you kind of in a different way, y'know...
