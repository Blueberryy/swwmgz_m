**Nana** is the sole daughter of **Kaguya Houraisan**, the exiled **Lunarian** princess who made **Gensokyo** her home. Having been raised and homeschooled entirely within **Eientei** she did not know much of the outside world, and would have spent the rest of her immortal life there, had it not been for a chance encounter with **Ryuji Miyamoto** in the 60's. Having fled the **Human Village**, he came across Nana. The two became close friends, and the young boy made a promise to marry her when he grew up, and take her outside, so she could "see the world". This would happen in 1973, with the two leaving Gensokyo to form a family of their own.

Being related to royalty, Nana has become quite famous on Japan, even appearing on several talk shows. She is also well known for her skills in several martial arts, and has won many tournaments over the years. Other hobbies of hers include painting and woodworking, and she's also a very fine cook.

Nana has three children, who, like her, have also inherited the immortal blood of the moon princess: **Taro**, **Saya** and **Yui**. Each of them have been quite successful in their own exploits too, something Nana often extensively talks about, in a very proud manner.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfThe bestest mom in the world, not gonna lie. She may be strict at times, or get mad at me for staying up late (if she actually finds out, heh), but she really is the best. You haven't actually met her yet, Demo-chan, but I bet she'd really like you. I assure you she's real nice despite how scary she may look sometimes. She totally is not like Kaguya obaa-san, who I swear always has that aura about her that's like... no wonder guys are scared of her, always in constant fear of being CBT'd at any moment.\c-

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOkaa-san is so happy that you're out there doing good work. It was nice to see that she likes you. I did tell you, after all.\c-

\cfBy the way I did notice it, you know, when she hugged you, yes. She hasn't really tried to see other guys after dad was gone... But I think that maybe... she likes you kind of in a different way, y'know...\c-
