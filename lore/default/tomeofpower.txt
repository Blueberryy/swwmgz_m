**Tyketto's Tome of Power** is one among the seven treasured artifacts of the **Sidhe**, each said to contain within itself the immortal soul and timeless knowledge of one of the **Seraphs**, long lost ancestors of the Sidhe race. Among all of them, Tyketto's tome is most valued by warriors for the many weapon empowering spells that populate its pages.

It is unclear if this tome here is the original article or one of the many copies that were made, the only way to tell would be to ascertain that the soul of the Seraph **Teejalla** rests within it.

\cfBy the way, I swear I heard that thing talk once. No, really.\c-
