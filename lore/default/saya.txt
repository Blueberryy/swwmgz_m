Full Name: Saya Miyamoto
Nationality: Japanese
Date Of Birth: 1993-03-20

Summary: Born in 1993 in to Nana and Ryuji Miyamoto. Has two siblings: An older brother, Taro (1985), and a younger sister, Yui (2009). As a child she already showed interest in science and technology. At the very early age of 13 she graduated in Computer Science at MIT. Her first project was an autonomous house-cleaning robot, which would later evolve into the modern Maidbot built in Akari Labs, the company she co-founded with Taro in 2010. In 2018, due to the immortality inherited from her grandmother, she ceased aging. However, thanks to this she has been able to keep working on everything she ever wanted. To this day, there are hundreds of different projects under her name, this includes you, the Demolitionist.

Addendum: Saya is often called "Not-Tomoko" around the net, due to similarities to the protagonist of a popular 21st century manga series. She is well known for being quite blunt when talking to people, and also for being exaggeratedly flirty around attractive women. Her favourite colour is red, favourite animal is the otter, and favourite dish is pepperoni pizza. She also enjoys drone metal. Likes baggy clothes, refuses to wear skirts, only pants. Uses Arch, favourite editor is Vim, favourite programming language is Haskell. Her top "turn-ons" are well-endowed women, maids, femboys and heterochromia. She doesn't use deodorant or cologne, although people around her remark that her BO is "kind of nice actually". Among other hobbies, Saya really enjoys writing. Her first foray into manga, "My Maid is a Sex Robot", became successful enough to get an anime adaptation.

Saya's Note: I'm sure you enjoy reading all about me, Demo-chan, but you have more important things to be doing, isn't that right?
