The **Companion Lamp** is one of the most popular souvenirs among visitors of **Sankaideriha**, the island of magic. This enchanted metal oil lantern, once acquired and bonded to its owner, will follow them around wherever they go. It can be lit and unlit through sheer force of will, thanks to its strong link to its owner. While active, it will illuminate the area around you with a bright green light. It's recommended to only keep it on when truly needed, to conserve its limited oil supply.

Please do note that these lamps have a tendency to attract moths, however, this can be used for your advantage, as the lamp's enchantment will extend to them too, imbuing them with the desire to protect the lamp's owner from harm, which will cause them to immediately attack once the lamp is unlit and they are no longer entranced by its glow.

The lamp always stays by its owner's side, without fail. Should they disappear from view or move too far away for the lamp to catch up with, it will instantly transport itself nearby.

\cfI totally did not get this thing because I like moths or anything, well actually MAYBE I did. I mean, when the lady at the store told me about it I uhhh, kinda just asked without thinking if moth girls would also be attracted by it. She laughed at me :T\c-

\cfBut... actually, afterwards I think she did say that "maybe". Which honestly, does sound kinda... whew. In a way, I'd like the idea, but at the same time... I hope we don't end up regretting this.\c-

\cfOh god imagine if moth girls actually are real, I'd fucking... ffffffdfgdgfgsfgggghghffhghg\c-
