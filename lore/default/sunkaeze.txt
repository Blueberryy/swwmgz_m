Summary: A completely barren planet, thought to be completely empty, until an expedition discovered the ruins of a facility belonging to the defunct Decade Mechanics, an ancient industrial group founded by the late mechanical demigod Maester Mekes.

Saya's Note: Gods, demigods... all this stuff... One would hardly believe such things to exist but come on, after finding out that aliens are very real, it's hard to not believe in this stuff too. Hell, I MET one once... like I'm not even bullshitting you here, I met a LITERAL GOD. It happened when I was visiting Yui's girl: there was with this nerdy-looking lady that gave off this sort of "aura". Her name's Mykka, and she was really nice to talk to, even gave me some candy. Boy I wish I could just talk more about this stuff, but I don't want to fill these entries with unrelated info.
