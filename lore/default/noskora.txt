Name: University of Nos-Kora
Classification: The world's most unorthodox source of knowledge
Location: Mishe Embassy, Nahkami

Summary: The University of Nos-Kora is a rather peculiar place of study founded by the brothers Nukritas 1xx and Nukritas 2xx. It is world renown for being host to all sorts of exotic courses, some promising to provide hidden knowledge that no other institution in the world could ever be capable of providing.

Addendum: The University is led by the last two surviving members of the ancient Mishe race, known to be all-powerful reality benders. You really do not want to get into the brothers' bad side.

Saya's Note: Those guys are crazy, really damn crazy, aaaaaaall screws loose, which actually does make them pretty entertaining to talk with, mind you. It's like... you're being showered with arcane knowledge mixed with non-sequiturs and facts about geese you never wanted to know. Also one of them punched the ol' emperor for the shit he did in WW3, so they're ok in my book.
