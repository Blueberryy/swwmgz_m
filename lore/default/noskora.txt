The **University of Nos-Kora** was founded in 1308 by the brothers **Nukritas 1xx** and **Nukritas 2xx**, sole ambassadors of the mysterious **Mishe** race in **Nahkami**. This rather peculiar place of study is world renown for being host to all sorts of exotic courses, some even promising to provide students with hidden knowledge that no other institution in the entire universe could be capable of delivering.

Being part of the Mishe, the two brothers have what can only be described as "reality manipulation" powers. This has only been witnessed on rare occassions, however, such as during the final moments of the **Nukuri Seventh World War**, where one of them managed to singlehandedly put a stop to the conflict, shrugging off the attacks of imperial soldiers while making his way to the throne, whereupon reaching it, he punched emperor **Ledora Yathai** off his seat, launching him across the room in a perfectly straight line towards the nearest window, and sending him off into low orbit. His body was never recovered, and he was presumed dead.

The popularity of the university skyrocketed following this success in dismantling a whole empire and ultimately bringing forth the creation of the **Nukuri Unified Government**. Many people wish to learn of what these odd beings have to teach, although the verious courses are quite difficult for the average individual.

Some of the more popular courses one can take at the University of Nos-Kora include:

\cfMechanics of Truth:\c- A special course on the fundamental unified theory of existence, said to be the very foundation upon which the knowledge and ability of the Mishe race was built.

\cfPancake Engineering:\c- An oddly-named course on the principles of the three layers of reality and their interactions, along with methods for "bending them to your will". This course has one of the highest dropout rates, as most students are driven to insanity during the first few years.

\cfFoundations of Astronomic Engineering:\c- A course on the basics of creating whole planets from scratch. Also covers some topics of bioengineering. This one is generally only open to deities, or other species capable of such an act.

\cfEssential History:\c- Recommended to anyone seeking to know every last detail of the universe's growth and evolution, although it's best to be from a species that lives long enough to be capable of surviving this 730 year long course. The brothers have said that this is all that's needed to cover "the essentials" of history, though.

On the side, the university and its two founders also manage their own little store, **Plutoni Incorporated**, where various odd artifacts and services from the founders themselves or their most successful pupils are made available for purchase.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI have to say it, those guys are crazy, like, REALLY damn crazy, all fucking screws loose. But it's actually kind of a good thing, once you get used to it (it took me a while). Getting past the complete insanity, you get to be showered with all sorts of forbidden knowledge... or random facts about geese, like that one time... (but I think that was just them trying to avoid answering some sensitive questions).\c-

\cfMad props tho for ending a fucking war (and ending a fucking emperor too) just like that. Fucking... yeeting the guy into orbit, wow. You really don't want to mess with them when they go into serious mode, holy fuck.\c-
