Born in 2009 to **Nana** and **Ryuji Miyamoto**, **Yui** is the youngest of three siblings. She's quite an empathetic and sociable person, completely unlike her relatively gloomier, more reclusive older sister and brother **Saya** and **Taro**, having always shown a clear interest in helping other people. Since her childhood, her wish had been to become a doctor, "to save lives". This wish came to fruition after persevering through her studies, and many years slowly "ascending the ranks". As of this article's writing, Yui currently works as a neurosurgeon at **Kasukabe Central Hospital**, and has received several awards for her outstanding achievements.

On a more personal side, Yui has a wide variety of interests, which some have noted as amusing in how contrasting they can be. For example, she's known to be an avid fan of wrestling, but she's just as crazy about it as she is for chess. She also enjoys various types of music that would normally be felt as "conflicting" with each other. Truly, Yui Miyamoto is a woman of contrasts. \cf[ed. note: thanks, spat all over my keyboard here]\c-

For a long time, Yui had been a fan of a certain British band, **The Black Rat's Coven**. She really enjoyed their music, and was absolutely enamored with the lead singer, **Ashley Knox**. She often fantasized about dating her, much to the mockery of her friends, and truly, seriously wished one day she'd show up at her door, asking her to be her girlfriend.

All of this was clearly never going to happen, and she knew it, but one day, the band visited Japan during one of their tours, and she got to see them live. Yui and her sister, who was also a fan, were quick to get tickets for the concert and head there as fast as they could. The experience was something else, being so close to them. Yui could swear that sometimes, Ashley would look at her and smile, but she dismissed it as probably being her imagination, or something.

After the concert, she excitedly lined up to get an autograph, and that's when the impossible became possible. Once in front of the **"Stylish Witch of the West"**, Yui nervously asked her, but what she got instead were some words that left her frozen in place: "You're a very cute gal. Wanna go out with me?". Suffice to say, the two are now happily married.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfghfjksdhfsjkghsdkfjsfgj I was so happy for her but also JEALOUS, YES, VERY JEALOUS. God when that happened I thought she was going to pass out, big tiddy goth gf asking her out like that out of the blue, holy fucking shit...\c-

\cfSo apparently, Yu-chan is EXACTLY her type, talk about a crazy coincidence, huh? A match made in fucking heaven right there. Honestly, this stinks so much of cliche-y love-at-first-sight romance that, whew... I bet it's hard to believe such a story. Ashley-san even jokingly said that "love at first sight" is something that runs in her family. Pffff...\c-

\cfDamn her, having a hot big tiddy goth gf all for herself... I really was jealous. Well, I was, until I had Ibuki, heheheheh.\c-
