Full Name: Yui Miyamoto
Nationality: Japanese
Date Of Birth: 2009-07-02

Summary: Born in 2009 to Nana and Ryuji Miyamoto. Yui is the youngest of three brothers. Unlike her older siblings Taro and Saya, she never really showed any interest in science and tech. Instead her dream was to become a doctor, to save lives. She currently works as a neurosurgeon at Kasukabe Central Hospital, and has received several awards.

Addendum: Yui is currently married to Ashley Knox, the "Stylish Witch of the West" famous for her special blend of Rock and Gothic. She had been her fan for many years, and after a concert, she approached the witch for an autograph, it was then, at that very moment, that a miracle happened: Ashley asked her out on a date. Ever since then, the've become unseparable.

Saya's Note: Yu-chan was never really into our whole thing, that's for sure, but I'm still proud af as her onee-san that she's out there helping people, and also jealous af too because her girl is so DAMN HOT AAAAAAAAA.
