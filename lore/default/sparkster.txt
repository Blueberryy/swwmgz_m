Designation: Model S-5 Biospark Carbine
Manufacturer: Decade Mechanics

Summary: Ancient energy weapon. Its internal operation is undergoing investigation by Tach-Engine Technologies for potential improvements.

Primary Fire: Small blobs of stabilised energy with slight target-seeking abilities.

Secondary Fire: Concentrated, penetrating beam shot.

Tertiary Fire: If the loaded charge is at least at 50%, the containment capsule within will be ejected through the main barrel and detonated as a massive sphere of pure energy that tracks down nearby targets. The weapon must be reloaded afterwards.

Reload: Reloads, obviously.

Addendum: If the secondary beam comes in contact with an energy blob it will be detonated with increased damage and range.

Saya's Note: This thing's rusty af but still works somehow. Good tech, wow.
