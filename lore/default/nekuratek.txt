Summary: Nekuratek was founded by Zanata Nekuraku I in 1744, as Nekuraku Rafana Sakosai (Nekuraku Arms Manufactory), it quickly became the main provider of weaponry for the Nukuri Empire. Following the death of Zanata I in 1870, the company's leadership was transferred to her granddaughter Zanata II, who decided to further expand into other fields, such as robotics and information technology, and gradually began to cut down on the fabrication of weaponry. Since the fall of the empire, the company is dedicated entirely to robotics and computing, with their old arms manufactory division being split off and led by Zanata II's son Zanaveth I. The last transfer of leadership was to Zanaveth II in 2128.

Addendum: Nekuratek is most famous for the creation of the Nekern Architecture, a human-compatible hardware platform that powers all Nukuri systems, and the Nekuronbot AI, a lifelike, highly expandable artificial intelligence framework that's been used for various things, from personal assistant bots to self-driving vehicles.

Saya's Note: Good people to work with, especially Zana-sama. She's a lot more outgoing than her predecessor, that's for sure, and much cuter, too, heheh...
