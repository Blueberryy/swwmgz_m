Full Name: Ryuji Miyamoto
Nationality: Japanese
Date Of Birth: 1956-03-12
Date Of Death: 2054-06-22

Summary: Ryuji was a well-known inventor from Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture. He was the husband of Nana Miyamoto, and father to Taro, Saya and Yui. In 2054 he passed away, being unable to recover from a stroke he suffered while jogging. He was buried in the bamboo forest surrounding Eientei, Gensokyo, where he and Nana first met.

Addendum: He designed the house in which they family resides to this day. It was built as a secure underground facility, that would keep his family protected from any catastrophe that might happen to the world. Over time the small structure got expanded, and it is now currently large enough to host most of the workforce for Akari Labs.

Saya's Note: He was the best dad. I learned so much from him, and he was always super-happy to see me get interested in inventing stuff like him... Thinking back to those days really is no good... ah... damn it... I'm not crying, I swear...
