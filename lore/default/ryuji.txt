**Ryuji** was born in **Gensokyo** in 1956, spending most of his life within the **Human Village**, the only one settlement within the region inhabited entirely by humans, rather than Youkai. During his early teens, he became quite rebellious, desiring to leave the village and have "adventures". One day, he fled, and got himself lost in the bamboo forest surrounding **Eientei**. There, he came across **Nana**, the daughter of **Kaguya Houraisan**, and the two became friends. After guiding him back to the village, Ryuji promised her that he'd return one day, to marry her, and take her with him to see the outside world.

Ryuji and Nana made their "escape" in 1973, and settled in the city of Kasukabe, where the two formed a family, starting with their first son, **Taro** in 1985, who would be followed later on by **Saya** in 1993 and **Yui** in 2009.

While working a typical office job to support the family, Ryuji would additionally have one notable hobby on the side, as an "inventor". He would often come up with all sorts of clever tools and machines to help make work around the house easier, and would even get extra money selling some of them to neighbours. His skills gradually improved with time, every year rising one step further in their complexity and scale. Earning him fame throughout the whole city.

One of his most notable achievements is the very house the Miyamoto family lives in. By 2015, their old house was completely reconstructed into a high security underground facility, that would keep the family safe from any catastrophe that might happen to the world. This initial underground home was later expanded even further, as the company formed by Saya and Taro, **Akari Labs**, kept growing. And as of this article's writing, it is large enough to host most of the workforce of the company.

In 2035, seeing that Akari Labs was pulling in more money than he ever could, he decided to retire early and take a back seat, watching over his children and their work.

Ryuji unfortunately passed away in 2054, after being unable to recover from a stroke he suffered during a daily jog. This came as a surprise, as he was known to be in good health, despite being 98 at the time, in his words, having reached such an age thanks to "leading a healthy and happy lifestyle". After a long period of mourning, Nana brought his ashes to Gensokyo and spread them in the bamboo forest surrounding Eientei, where the two had first met.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfHe was the best dad, and I learned so much from him, and he was always super happy to see me get interested in inventing things just like him. He was really proud of us, and worked a lot so we could get to where we are now. Akari Labs... it would have never existed if it wasn't for dad.\c-

\cfUgh, thinking back to those days, it really is no good, damn it. We all knew, that he wasn't immortal like us and we'd lose him one day, but we really weren't ready, especially mom. It was really, really painful...\c-

\cfI'm not crying, I swear.\c-
