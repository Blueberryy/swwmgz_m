Summary: A man shrouded in mystery. Claims to be the "son of Benellus, God of Shotguns". He is one of the main financial backers of Blackmann Arms and has commissioned several unique weapons from them, most kept private. From his fortress in Nevada he frequently broadcasts himself talking about a coming "apocalyptic event" that he's been preparing for.

Saya's Note: So, basically, just some crazy, I get it. But see, one of the designs from this guy was made public, and I couldn't help it but try getting my hands on that thing. I just want to see what it's like for you to handle that ballbusting hunk of metal. I've even given you enhancements to more efficiently utilize it. Any time you're using it I'll be watching, so you better give me something fun to eat popcorn with.
