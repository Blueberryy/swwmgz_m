A man shrouded in mystery, having appeared out of nowhere, announcing himself to be the son of **Benellus, God of Shotguns**. The believability of this story is quite questionable, despite the insistence of his own mother, who claims that the god descended from the heavens, and giving her one "blessed shotgun shell", she was ordered to plant it on the ground, as from it, a man would be born, who would become the "mightiest wielder of the ultimate firearm". She said that John, already fully grown, sprung up from the ground only days after the shell was planted, and immediately proceeded to "make shotguns burst from the ground around himself", and he used the metals from them to build the very fortress the family has in the Nevada desert.

Despite all this odd storytelling, the man himself does appear to hold quite a lot of power, as he is the major financial backer of **Blackmann Arms**, the world renown manufacturer of "exotic firearms". He has commissioned several unique weapons from them, most kept private. One unique exception was that of the mythical **Wallbuster**, a behemoth of a shotgun sporting 25 barrels and a unique internal operation mechanism that some have dubbed **Kraut Deep Space Magic** due to its ludicrous complexity. Despite this one weapon being available to the public, no one has dared to acquire a single unit, with the exception of **Akari Labs**, who immediately jumped in to have that weapon become part of the **Demolitionist**'s arsenal.

\cfYeah, dude's crazy, but see, THAT thing... I really REALLY wanted it. I even met up with the guy to get my hands on it. That shit is like... completely fucking insane, and I bet no living human would be able to fucking use it, BUT... you definitely can. Just so you know, every time you whip out that ballbusting hunk of metal, I'll be watching, so you better give me some fine entertainment to munch popcorn to.\c-

Following the Demon invasion of 2148, he began broadcasting messages from his fortress about "a much worse threat" coming up. In his own words: "The biggest battle humanity will face, and the biggest face humanity will battle". No one has yet understood this cryptic message, nor has he explained himself further.

\cfAlso, no fucking clue what that thing about fights and faces and shit is. Honestly I'm not surprised the guy survived the whole thing, probably blasted a thousand demons himself with the shit he's got in there, too.\c-

Following the Demon invasion of 2148, he began broadcasting messages from his fortress about "a much worse threat" coming up. In his own words: "The biggest battle humanity will face, and the biggest face humanity will battle". While seemingly cryptic at first, this prophecy did become true in 2174, when a massive sinkhole opened up somewhere in Orlando, Florida, and from it, a giant floating human head sprung forth and, with a deafening scream, leveled the whole city, covering it in bouncing, exploding, screaming smaller copies of itself. Thanks to the prediction, however, one lone Florida man, **John A. Bortson III**, who had been trained by Mr. BIG SHOT himself, managed to defeat it, before its influence and destruction could spread any further. Despite the craziness of this whole incident, it is something that, indeed, truly happened, much to the disbelief of many around the world.

\cfDude like... WHAT THE FUCK??? I swear, when I started seeing posts about it I thought it was all fake, it HAD to be fake. Are you fucking shitting me? A goddamn... giant face just pops up out of nowhere, a face that, mind you, looks exactly like that guy... you know, the guy the UAC kept sending everywhere, that one marine... yeah.\c-

\cfSeriously, I've SEEN a lot of weird shit, but that one takes the fucking grand prize. AND OF COURSE IT HAD TO HAPPEN IN FLORIDA, OF ALL PLACES.\c-
