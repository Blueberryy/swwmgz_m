The city of **Sankaideriha** was founded countless aeons ago by **LS**, one of the three primordial deities, who represents all magic. It is located atop a large floating island, hovering onto an endless ocean of pure magic essence. Sankaideriha is home to thousands of magic users from all fields and levels of expertise, and also serves as a refuge to creatures of magical nature that face persecution, such as the last remaining members of the **Pynn** race. The city also hosts a variety of places of study, along with several shops, these serving as its main source of income.

The city is led by the **High Tribunal of Witches**, of which LS is part of, along with other witches of renown, such as **Kana Sankai**, head of the **Counter-Inquisition**, the city's main military force who serve not just to protect the city itself, but also magic users living abroad who are endangered by anti-mage persecutors, and **Saniuke Okusainaya**, who is well known for being the first **Nukuri** technomancer, successful in bridging the gap between the arcane and the modern.

The main way in and out of Sankaideriha is a very well-guarded secret among its inhabitants, essentially making it an "invitation only" location. Nonetheless, any skilled mage can simply create a portal to it as needed.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI've been there with Ashley-san a couple times. It's SUPER PRETTY, seriously. Most damn beautiful place I've ever seen in my entire life, holy fuck. The view from up there, it's literally out of this world. And all the stuff in there, so good too, ah damn...\c-

\cfOh yeah, first time I went, I met the big god. They're uhhhh... interesting, to say the least. Didn't mind having a chat with some random nobody like me who has super-mediocre magic skills, which was fun. One of these days, when I retire, I might move there and study a lot of cool magic.\c-

One of these days, when Kirin-kun retires, we're going to move there and study lots of magic together. I'm so looking forward to it...\c-
