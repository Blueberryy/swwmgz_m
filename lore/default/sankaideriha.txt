Name: Sankaideriha
Classification: City
Location: Self-Contained

Summary: Sankaideriha is a floating island located above an endless ocean of magic energy. It is the home to thousands of witches and wizards. The way in and out is a very well-guarded secret among its inhabitants. The city was founded by LS, a very reclusive individual with inmeasurable magical powers, who also leads the High Tribunal of Witches.

Addendum: Noteworthy people from the island include Saniuke Okusainaya, the first Nukuri technomancer, and Kana Sankai, the leader of the Counter-Inquisition, a group dedicated to protect magic users from persecution outside of Sankaideriha.

Saya's Note: Yui's girl took us there once, it's SUPER PRETTY, seriously. There's so much stuff that's just... wow. And the view from up there... ohhh... I'd love to go again.
