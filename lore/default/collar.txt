This is a very stylish and fashionable accessory, personally crafted by **Saya Miyamoto**, with much love and care, and additionally infused with protective magical energy by **Ashley Knox**. As long as you wear this, your adventures will become much easier, especially if you're prone to accidentally hitting yourself with your own explosives. It can also absorb most of the damage you receive should you be in REAL danger, potentially allowing you to make an escape. One final detail of note is that no matter what, it will never break.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfFor the last time! It's NOT a BDSM thing, I swear to god. Everyone keeps poking me about it, and every time it's the same. It's just a damn cool thing that I thought would look good on you, and on Ibuki too, but people keep misinterpreting it, *sigh*...\c-

\cfI gotta say, tho, it really does look super cute on both of you. And damn, if Yu-chan's big tiddy goth gf can work some magic in there. I forgot to put it there in the main entry, but there's also another thing about the collar. Ashley-san taught me, that when whoever's wearing it is like... about to die, I can "recall" you here at will. So yeah, just so you know, if you go down in there and can't do an emergency reboot, you won't be lost forever, I'll make sure to bring you back and patch you up real nice, I promise.\c-
