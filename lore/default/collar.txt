Designation: Lucky Collar for Demolitionist
Manufacturer: Saya Miyamoto

Summary: A very stylish fashion accessory, personally crafted by Saya, with much love and care, and infused with some borrowed magical energy that will keep the wearer protected.

Protection:
 - 75% reduction to all damage when below 25% health.
 - 50% reduction to all self-inflicted damage.

Addendum: The collar cannot break no matter how much damage you receive.

Saya's Note: I made one for Ibuki too. Looks super cute on both of you tbh. I swear this isn't some BDSM thing. Also holy fuck if Yui's big tiddy goth gf can do some magic.
