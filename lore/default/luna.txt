Name: Luna Event
Classification: Alien Contact
Date: February 2021

Summary: Name given to the first contact between humans and the Nukuri race, who had been observing us for centuries from within a hidden research facility on the Moon. This was something that Nikita Kunau, head of human studies, had planned for many years, although she didn't expect to do it so soon, but there was no other choice, as a major threat to the planet had surfaced, a rogue AI known as SUSAN, undefeatable by any weapon humanity could produce. Following the hasty announcement, Nukuri forces were deployed and successfully neutralized the AI at its core, a megastructure located on the seas north of Kereshnovka. After all was over, the Nukuri would begin to make themselves at home among us.

Addendum: The alliance with the Nukuri provided a major boost in scientific advancements for the human race, thanks to their much more advanced technology becoming available to us. Unfortunately, all this came to an end when WW3 happened.

Saya's Note: Man, I miss those days. Back then you'd see all sorts of Nukuri cuties in the street, and I'd pretty much hang out with Zana-sama every weekend. Nowadays with the "White Scar" treaty in effect, life just sucks.
