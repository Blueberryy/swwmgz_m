During the final days of the **SUSAN** rogue AI incident, when all hope was lost for mankind's survival, one very unexpected event happened. An emergency message was sent from the Moon, overtaking all video and radio signals. It was the announcement of an alien species making their presence known. The full transcript is as follows:

\cf"This is a message for all of humankind. We are the Nukuri. For thousands of years we have observed you, studied you, while in hiding. We were to ensure absolute secrecy, and avoid influencing your developments in any way, until the time was right for our first contact. However, the current circumstances call for this contact to happen much sooner than we had planned. Your world is in immediate danger of ultimate destruction, and we shall not stand still and watch. Do not fear, the threat will be dealt with soon. May the stars shine bright on you."\c-

Following the announcement, SUSAN's countdown to destruction was halted, and control of Russia's missile systems was reestablished. The **Nukuri** had somehow remotely neutralized the AI at its core, as nothing could truly be observed by the units stationed right outside the range of its self-defense systems, the whole structure simply shut itself down.

Shortly after, and over many days, regular communications with the Nukuri would happen. Many questions would be answered, such as their origins (a remote solar system called **Xathar**, located in the Andromeda galaxy), how long had they been studying us (since 1309 BC), and if they were peaceful (to this last one, there was a long pause before getting a simple "yes", which raised some concerns).

On May 11th of 2021, an alliance between humans and Nukuri was finally signed, after the first reunion of **Emperor Ledora Yathai** with the leaders of the major nations of Earth. By the end of the year, many among the Nukuri had already made themselves at home in our planet, most coming from the **Luna Research Institute for Human Studies**, who desired to have a more in-depth experience of our culture.

In addition, the alliance provided humanity with a major boost in technological development, thanks to their various advances and knowledge being made available to us. Among other things, the Nukuri put a lot of effort into making their own computer technology compatible with ours, resulting in the powerful **Nekern Architecture**. They also helped alleviate the struggles for clean energy by introducing us to the **Nokorokinylum Microfusion Engine**, a method of cold fusion requiring little space and equipment, but also rather exotic elements (which are thankfully easily available in their homeworld).

These major changes also brought the attention of other species, neighbours of the Nukuri, who also showed interest in us. Humanity was made aware of just how, despite the vast emptiness of it all, the universe has much more life in it that one could have imagined. Plans had been made, for Earth to become part of the so-called **X'Animen Coalition**, an interplanetary association the Nukuri were part of.

However, it all came to a sudden end when, in June of 2073, **World War 3** began. In a single year, our alliance, all the great advancements, everything was completely undone, in what is often cited as the biggest mistake in human history: **The White Scar**.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfEveryone really thought it was all over by then. Even us, with our damn anti-apocalypse bunker of a house. There was no way that we'd survive what that thing was going to do, practically setting off all the fucking nukes it could reach at once. And then THAT happened, kind of cliched af to be done right at the very last moment, a fucking heroic save like that. Bet they did it on purpose to look cool, heh.\c-

\cfAnyway, life was good back then, with all those Nukuri cuties hanging out with us. You could see so many of them in the street, and well, that was also when I met Zana-sama too, best goddamn Christmas gift of my life, heh. Really REALLY miss those days, you know, pretty much hanging out with her every weekend or so. Nowadays, life just plain sucks, and I can only ever get the chance to like, send and get messages super-rarely by passing them through the Lunar Embassy (when those stupid-ass rabbits actually do their jobs).\c-

\cfI really wish things would go back to how they used to be. I mean, sure, since our country didn't sign the bullshit White Scar treaty we can still use their tech, but they can't come here themselves, nor are we allowed to go there either. Fuck all that shit.\c-
