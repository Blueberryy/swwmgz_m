The **Universal Ammo Fabricators** are portable devices capable of building any type of ammunition from scratch, through a process of "subatomic reconfiguration" of the base construction materials found within it. The exact nature of this process has not been truly explained, but the device is indeed capable of generating pretty much anything, up to a certain limit based on material cost. **Cyrus** provides four models of these devices, each of them increasing in cost but also in its production capabilities (with the highest tier being advertised as "capable of producing enough ammunition to supply a whole army"). This distribution model allows even those with a tighter budget to benefit from this technology.
