Name: Sidhe
Location: Parthoris

Summary: An elf species native to this world, they have a natural bond with magic and are known to be great fighters. As the story goes they however face persecution by other groups due to the opposition to the current ruler. Most of them have been killed in the war, only few remain. It is your mission to help them.

Addendum: It's possible that your horns might appear as "pointy ears" to the locals and you might be confused for a Sidhe. Use this to your advantage if necessary.

Saya's Note: How do you exactly pronounce "Sidhe" anyway? Also, do they get angry if you use things made of wood? I MUST KNOW!
