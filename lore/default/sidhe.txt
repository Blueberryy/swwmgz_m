The **Sidhe** are one of the main native species of the world of **Parthoris**. Quite close to fantasy elves, in a way. They have a natural bond with magic, and are also known to be skilled fighters, too. Before the arrival of the **Serpent Riders**, they had served as sacred guardians of the seven nations, but once these demonic creatures made themselves present, they were the only ones who refused to serve them, unlike how the rest had so easily surrendered themselves.

Those who once revered the Sidhe people had now turned against them, under the control of the Riders, and the armies of the seven kingdoms were sent forth to destroy them. Very few have survived, scattered throughout the world. While most have decided to hide themselves, others have plans for revenge. Of note is a small group which we made our first contact with, and from whom we learned about most of the situation in this world. They had placed their hope on a lone Sidhe, named **Corvus**, who showed quite a lot of promise. However, once faced with the **Demolitionist**, he instead opted for us to take the lead here. It is now our mission to save these people, and their world.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, these elves were quick to just shove all this hero stuff onto you, weren't they. But it's fine, it's all good fun for you, I can tell. You really like playing that part, don't ya?\c-

\cfBy the way, how do you even pronounce that? This "Sidhe" name... Is it like... "sidey"? nah, that doesn't sound right... hm, whatever.\c-

\cfI just hope they don't get angry if we use things made out of wood, that'd be a major problem.\c-
