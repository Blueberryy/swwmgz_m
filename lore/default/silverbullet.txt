The **Silver Bullet JET** is the 1.150 member of the **Silver Bullet** series of ultra-high caliber rifles manufactured by **Blackmann Arms**. It was created as a lighter, more "reasonable" alternative to the 1.350 **Behemoth** model. Weighing 43 kilograms and sporting a total length of 2.4 meters, it is sufficiently compact for non-augmented human use.

The main ammunition designed for this specific model is the 1.150 **XSB (eXplosive Super Burst)**. These beastly rounds are partially based on a NATO standard 30x113mm cartridge, and employ a low density **Explodium** shaped charge as propellant, allowing high velocity while still being safe for use. The bullets themselves are composed of a tungsten carbide core, snugly wrapped in an aluminum jacket, and decorated with a thin silver plating for aesthetic appearance (Silver Bullets are, indeed, NOT really made of silver).

In order to compensate for its massive recoil, the weapon redirects a part of the gasses from round ignition into a set of jet compensators designed by **Forx Aeronautics**. Although partially cooled in the process, it is still hot enough to cause some damage to users not wearing adequate protection.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Shoot the bullet. Any small targets hit by it are pretty much turned to paste. In addition, there's the potential for it to penetrate several targets in a row before eventually stopping, depending on their size.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Custom-tailored adjustable telescopic sight, up to 16x. Equipped with a soft foam covering to protect the user's face during scoped fire.

\cfReloading:\c- Reloads the weapon. Each magazine holds 5 rounds. An extra round can also be kept chambered.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWhat was that quote again, "there is no kill like overkill"? Yeah, sounds about right for this thing.\c-

\cfThe fuck are you even supposed to hunt with it, wild tanks? I suppose... bigass beefy demons could also count, but you're going to just turn them all to fucking paste.\c-
