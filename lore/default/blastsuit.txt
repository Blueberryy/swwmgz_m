A simple, easy to wear vest, designed to protect against explosives. Its main body is made of very elastic nanofabrics, which should provide additional protection against small arms. The heavy plating on the front is made of a highly shock-absorbing proprietary alloy, which is capable of absorbing most of the brunt of force of any explosion near the wearer. The manufacturer even advertises that "it can even block RPGs", though this has never been put to the test.

\cxAnalysis data:\c-
This piece of armor appears to be able to reduce most incoming damage by a factor of 30%, and also completely halve any explosive impact received by the wearer. It can absorb up to 150 "units of damage" before it becomes unusable. Furthermore, it can be worn under other other types of armor, allowing for combined protection.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfDon't even ask about it, I seriously don't know what this about "units of damage" means. We had that nerdo from Cyrus Enterprises run the tests for us. I swear, he's always acting like everything's a fucking videogame, just like how he also insists on doing the whole thing of scattering equipment around on purpose for you to pick up. BUT I can't really do jack shit about it. He's the one paying the bills... Yeah, all that cash you're piling up? That's him, he calls it your "score". Seriously... fucking nerd...\c-
