Name: Explodium
Classification: Highly explosive material

Summary: Devised by Parker Munch during the early stages of his weapon invention spree. It is a mixture of highly volatile elements that combusts violently when ignited or struck. A single gram of the stuff has the explosive yield of a standard issue hand-grenade.

Addendum: The usage of this substance is highly regulated due to the dangers posed by its misuse. It's rumored that "small bombs" are often sold in black markets and used for assassinations.

Saya's Note: FUCKING CALLED IT. So the "small bombs" theory could have been correct! And people laughed at me... HA! Now I'm the one who laughs, losers.
