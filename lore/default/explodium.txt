**Explodium** is a proprietary mixture of highly volatile elements that combusts violently when ignited or struck. What sets it apart from all other high-grade plastic explosives is the obscenely high yield of even a single gram of this material, which is comparable to that of a standard issue hand grenade.

The material was initially invented by a group of anonymous researchers, then bought by **Parker Munch**, son of the founder of **Munch Innovations**, who in addition obtained all rights to reproduce and commercialize it. Its first use was in the **Explodium Gun**, an easily portable "pocket exploder" that saw massive commercial success, allowing the company to climb the ranks of the world's top arms manufacturers, despite the fact that, had it not been for Parker's interests in weaponizing it, they would have never even considering entering that market, remaining solely as producers of smart appliances.

Though generally regulated due to the dangers posed by its misuse, it's common knowledge that Explodium is also often sold in black markets, and may have even been employed in the creation of "small bombs", used in certain acts of terror and gruesome assassinations.
