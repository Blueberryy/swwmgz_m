Name: Serpent Riders
Classification: Evil cult
Origin: Undetermined

Summary: A triad of evil sorcerers known all over these lands. All those who've dared fight against them haven't been very lucky. D'Sparil claimed the land of Parthoris, his many armies of undead having taken over the land before our arrival. Then in the land of Cronos there's Korax, a dark beast that taunts all those who challenge him. We haven't received much information on the third member, but this information will come eventually as we keep exploring these new worlds.

Saya's Note: I'm sure you can wipe out all these idiots without any issue, they have no idea of how strong you are (or of what you are, now that I think of it, these worlds hardly seem to know much about our technology).
