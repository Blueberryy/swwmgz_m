A very robust and durable plate armor made of the finest almasteel in **Devanikna**. Part of the standard lineup from **Unissix Crafts**, designed for the skilled adventurer who needs decent protection from the attacks of mighty beasts. It is also imbued with defensive magic that enhances elemental resistances on the wearer. Generally, this chestpiece is also distributed along with other parts comprising a full armor set, but it's not like you can wear all of them, with the body type you have.

\cxAnalysis data:\c-
This piece of armor offers a massive reduction to incoming damage of basic elemental nature (i.e.: heat, cold, electricity, etc.), the factor being of 80%. In addition, the plating itself offers a 50% reduction to damages of other natures, plus a 70% absorption of explosive impacts. The total absorption amounts to 250 units of damage before it's entirely worn out. Due to its size, it can easily be worn over lighter armors.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfNerdboi and his "armor analysis" once again. This guy, seriously... Life isn't a goddamn videogame, so please PLEASE stop talking in terms like "damage units" and "reduction factors".\c-

\cfAaaaanyway, Misa makes some pretty nifty stuff. I feel that it's a bit redundant that you're wearing armor made of the same stuff as your chassis. I mean, a robot wearing armor... yeah, why not? Protection is always important, huhu...\c-
