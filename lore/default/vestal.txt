**Vestal Foods** was formed in 2098 by members of the **Vesta Research Colony** established in the namesake asteroid, initiated as a way of showcasing the results of food cultivation in an off-Earth colony. They have gained traction recently thanks to the sponsorship of Akari Labs, with their repertoire gradually increasing over time as they receive requests for more varied snacks.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfThe folks at Vestal really know how to make the finest snacks, and it's a shame that they're not as well known because they're just a tiny coop made by scientists in some asteroid colony instead of a multi-billion dollar megacorp. I fiercely support them with all my love (and receive tasty treats in return).\c-
