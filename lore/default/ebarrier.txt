Part magic, part science, the **Elemental Coating** is one of the crowning achievements in defensive tech from the famous **Xekkian** inventor **Eushura Kmonn Jr.**. Once the device is primed, a thin but resilient coating of elemental repellant wraps itself around the user, providing them with complete protection against scorching magma, corrosive slime, freezing icewater, or even deadly radiation. For as long as the effects last, you can casually stroll around or even take a dip if you want.

This artifact is quite popular across all of **Ixxeney**, being a frequent purchase among adventurers of all nations.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfLil' reccomendation from Misa, this one. If it works as well as she says, you won't have much trouble dealing with all that slimy waste those UAC asshats keep leaking around (boy they sure don't care about the environment, huh). Or... well, I guess the firey flames of Hell won't toast your circuits either.\c-
