Name: The Ghoul Hunt
Classification: Interdimensional Conflict
Timeframe: 2007-2009

Summary: An incident in Kereshnovka where a high ranking UAAF official was found murdered in the town. The blame was put on the local ghouls, and a hunt began for them. At the same time, an envoy of the Anarukon was in the area trying to seize one of the ghouls for unknown reasons, and got caught in the crossfire. This last action resulted in the Imanaki HQ being invaded by Anarukon soldiers and subsequently destroyed.

Addendum: The "ghoul" that they were trying to find was later found out to be Manakei, current heir to the throne of Hell, who had gone missing well over a millenium ago after being summoned into the town by a mad druid.

Saya's Note: Info for this stuff is kind of messy, and I don't really know either what exactly is up with all of this. Bigass mess of scattered info. I'd try to get more out of it, but that'd mean asking nerdo for help.
