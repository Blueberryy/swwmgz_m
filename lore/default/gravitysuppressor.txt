Designation: Gravity Suppresor
Manufacturer: Cyrus Enterprises

Summary: Once attached and activated, this device negates the pull of gravity, allowing you to fly. While in the air, your acceleration is greatly increased.

Addendum: Due to the lack of a proper gravitational pull, it might be more difficult to orient oneself when in the air, or perform sharp movements.

Saya's Note: If it really is inverting gravity then why are you still following the trajectory of the planet you're on? Just a thought.
