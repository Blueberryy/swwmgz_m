Yet another display of the technological prowess of the **Qurensniv** people, the **Gravity Suppressor** is a device that, once attached and activated, is capable of completely negating the pull of gravity, allowing its user to freely float around in mid-air. However, while in this ingravid state, one may feel disoriented due to the lack of a proper point of reference for where the "ground" is, not to mention the difficulty in actually moving around. It is therefore recommended to have some auxiliary equipment for orientation and mobility when using it.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYou know, nerdboi hasn't really explained this, so I gotta ask... If this thing really does "negate the pull of gravity", then how come you still follow the orbit of the planet you're on? Wouldn't you just fly off into space as soon as you turn it on? Like, Earth moves pretty damn fast when you really think about it. You'd get fucking YEETED outside of its orbit and end up drifting through space and fucking dying or something... yeah.\c-
