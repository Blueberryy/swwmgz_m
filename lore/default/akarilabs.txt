Location: Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan

Summary: Akari Labs, the Fountain of Innovation, was founded in 2010 by Saya and Taro Miyamoto. While initially just a small robot workshop, they quickly grew over time, covering more diverse fields in the process. One of the labs' most popular products are the Maidbots, life-like humanoid assistant bots that can be freely adopted by any household: "from energetic, workaholic maids that do their job without asking questions, to tender, motherly maids who take special care of you and encourage you to improve your lifestyle". The labs are also famous for the creation of Ibuki, the "Red Oni", a WW3 veteran supersoldier, now turned supermodel, and in recent years, her successor, the Demolitionist.

Addendum: Akari Labs was one of the sponsors of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Saya's personal Maidbot singing the national anthem was one of the major highlights of the event.
