Designation: "Eviscerator" High Load Flak Cannon
Manufacturer: Mr. BIG SHOT Industries

Summary: Beastly portable artillery, turns fleshy targets into fine red mist in mere instants. Quite deadly for both its targets and also users not familiar with its operation.

Primary Fire: Detonates the shell directly, spreading hot steaming metal in front of the user.

Secondary Fire: Lobs the shell as a grenade, it will detonate on impact with any surface or object and release its payload in the direction it was facing when shot.

Reloading: Since the weapon reloads automatically and its internal ammo box has been linked to your Hammerspace Container, the reload button instead functions as a toggle for two spread modes on the primary fire.

Addendum: The metal fragments shot by this weapon will ricochet all over the place, which makes it very effective for shooting around corners.

Saya's Note: Why is there an "owo" face scribbled on every shell? Who did this? I want answers!
