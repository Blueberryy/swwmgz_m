Designation: Ghost Artifact
Manufacturer: Decade Mechanics

Summary: Cloaking device built from blueprints recovered from the abandoned facility on Sunkaeze. Generates a distortion bubble around the user that redirects outgoing photons, rendering them completely invisible.

Addendum: Note that this does not muffle sound, so you can still be heard clearly while it's active.
