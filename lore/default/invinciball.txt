Designation: Total Safety Device aka "Fucking Invinciball"
Manufacturer: Cyrus Enterprises

Summary: For a limited time, makes the user impervious to all harm that could come to them, even if self-inflicted.

Addendum: The device cannot protect against artifacts of Nedoshiaan, it is impossible.

Saya's Note: Is that a fucking MGR reference??? Does he even know how old the first game is? That meme is like... deader than dead!
