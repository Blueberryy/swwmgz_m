The **Fucking Invinciball**, alternatively known as the **Total Safety Device**, is a protective artifact that renders its user impervious to all harm that could come to them, even if self-inflicted. The exact nature of these effects is not clear, it is yet another mystery of **Cyrus Enterprises**'s highly advanced technology.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOK, is that seriously a fucking MGR reference??? Does this nerdo even know how OLD the first game is at this point? That's the deadest meme he could go for, holy shit!\c-

\cfOh, I guess you don't know what I'm talking about huh, well yeah. It was a pretty cool game series about slicing and dicing stuff, and memes, and something like that. I'll show you one day, but I bet you can't beat Misa's highest scores.\c-

\cfSpeaking of Misa, there's a little thing about this thingamajig that you should know. Sure, it makes you "invincible", but that fucking ultraweapon she made, the "Death Cannon" or whatever, it will NOT work against that. I think it's pretty amusing but also... really, you gotta be VERY CAREFUL with that thing.\c-

\cfOh man... you know what, maybe I should play some more. The sequel is really REALLY damn good. Like seriously, life would have sucked SO MUCH if they had actually gone through with kicking this guy out.\c-
