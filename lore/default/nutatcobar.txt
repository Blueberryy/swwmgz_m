\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfFun fact, I named this one myself. They were going to call them Vestal Bars, like, as a pun on Mars Bars I guess, but I felt inspired and needed to get this out. It was the perfect time to flex my ancient meme knowledge, you know.\c-

\cfSadly not many people get the reference. What a shame.\c-
