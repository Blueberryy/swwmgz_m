The **Health Geodesics** are a vast collection of artifacts discovered within some alien ruins in **Sedna**, during mankind's first travels to the other planetary systems in the **X'Animen Coalition** through a portal located in the remote dwarf planet. These ruins had somehow remained undiscovered by the **Nukuri**, despite their constant usage of the portal to travel between their system and ours. Even after a thorough exploration and study, there is not enough information to clearly identify which civilization they belonged to.

These artifacts have undergone very thorough study by **Tach-Engine Technologies**, the initial discoverers of the ruins, and right after the very first test on humans, immediately started being sold as "healing devices". No side effects of any kind have been found, despite many years of frequent use. 

Once the carrier holds the artifact tightly against their body, the glow from within the artifact will gradually fade, as it emits some unspecified form of "energy" that rapidly heals nearby wounds. Depending on the size and shape of the artifact, it may provide more or less healing potency.

Its effects also appear to not be limited only to healing organic tissue. Machinery is seemingly also affected, with the artifacts being able to repair even complex electronic devices.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOK so actually these things are pretty hard to come by, but after I had a lil' talk with the guy, we get to have a lot of them, so you're going to see them all around during your missions. I really don't want you to get hurt, you know, so make sure you use them, k?\c-
