Full Name: Misa Azadeku Unissix aka "Unissix Bokurou Azadeku"
Nationality: Devanikan
Date Of Birth: 1992-02-29

Summary: Misa is the lead arms designer of the entire Unissix family. Starting at a very early age, her fascination with weaponry has always been quite noticeable. Misa is highly skilled in the interpretation of ancient designs, and is thus often tasked with recreating lost technology. This has included the various Artifacts of Nedoshiaan. She is married to Zanaveth Nekuraku II, the leader of Nekuratek, a massive tech giant in the Nukuri homeworld.

Addendum: Her impressive skills in crafting could be seen as a way for her to compensate for the lack of physical prowess needed to become a Dragonblood warrior like her sister. When she met Zanaveth, who was by then just a student on a trip to learn about other cultures, she immediately became infatuated with her, and requested that they got married the next day. Afterwards, having settled in on Nahkami with her wife, Misa became a big fan of videogames, finding it rather exciting to finally be able to go on adventures of her own, without having to put much physical effort into it.

Saya's Note: I remember having some chats with her. She's got good taste, and her wife is hot af (and really smart, I mean she made the AI you're built on). I'm still pissy that we haven't been in contact much thanks to those American idiots causing the Nukuri to leave. I could send messages sometimes through the embassy in the Lunar Capital, but those damn bunnies always made it hard. BTW... I remember this one time we took a bath together and I saw... her down there... omg... huge... ohhhhhhh...... Zana-sama you lucky devil, no wonder I could hear you two going at it from across the house.

**Misa Azadeku Unissix** is the youngest member of the **Unissix Clan**, who leads the nation of **Devanikna**. She's the second child of **Devai Unissix** and **Serwand Nerukousei**, being the younger sister of **Deneva Unissix**, one of the most renowned warriors in the entire nation.

Due to being a child of mixed blood (as her father is not Devanikan, but rather a "Chimera", a term used to describe people born artificially through alchemical means), Misa was often shunned by members of other clans, who would describe her as a "crossbred monstrosity", and accuse her father of polluting the Unissix bloodline with nefarious intentions. Her sister would receive the same treatment, but was much more capable of ignoring it, while Misa however suffered a great deal during her whole life.

One thing that set her apart from her sister, was that she was much less physically capable, being "too weak" and "not suited to be a dragonblood warrior", it was noted too that unlike her brethren, she could not perform a dragon form summoning, either. All of this would also be used against her by the people who regularly bullied her. Her family eventually decided for her to always stay indoors, shut off from the outside world. It was through this that she eventually found her main hobby: Smithing.
