Full Name: Misa Azadeku Unissix aka "Unissix Bokurou Azadeku"
Nationality: Devanikan
Date Of Birth: 1992-02-29

Summary: Misa is the lead arms designer of the entire Unissix family. Starting at a very early age, her fascination with weaponry has always been quite noticeable. Misa is highly skilled in the interpretation of ancient designs, and is thus often tasked with recreating lost technology. This has included the various Artifacts of Nedoshiaan. She is married to Zanaveth Nekuraku II, the leader of Nekuratek, a massive tech giant in the Nukuri homeworld.

Addendum: Her impressive skills in crafting could be seen as a way for her to compensate for the lack of physical prowess needed to become a Dragonblood warrior like her sister. When she met Zanaveth, who was by then just a student on a trip to learn about other cultures, she immediately became infatuated with her, and requested that they got married the next day. Afterwards, having settled in on Nahkami with her wife, Misa became a big fan of videogames, finding it rather exciting to finally be able to go on adventures of her own, without having to put much physical effort into it.

Saya's Note: I remember having some chats with her. She's got good taste, and her wife is hot af (and really smart, I mean she made the AI you're built on). I'm still pissy that we haven't been in contact much thanks to those American idiots causing the Nukuri to leave. I could send messages sometimes through the embassy in the Lunar Capital, but those damn bunnies always made it hard. BTW... I remember this one time we took a bath together and I saw... her down there... omg... huge... ohhhhhhh...... Zana-sama you lucky devil, no wonder I could hear you two going at it from across the house.
