**Misa Azadeku Unissix** is the youngest member of the **Unissix Clan**, who leads the nation of **Devanikna**. She's the second child of **Devai Unissix** and **Serwand Nerukousei**, being the younger sister of **Deneva Unissix**, one of the most renowned warriors in the entire nation.

Due to being a child of mixed blood (as her father is not Devanikan, but rather a "Chimera", a term used to describe people born artificially through alchemical means), Misa was often shunned by members of other clans, who would describe her as a "crossbred monstrosity", and accuse her father of polluting the Unissix bloodline with nefarious intentions. Her sister would receive the same treatment, but was much more capable of ignoring it, while Misa however suffered a great deal during her whole life.

One thing that set her apart from her sister, was that she was much less physically capable, being "too weak" and "not suited to be a dragonblood warrior", it was noted too that unlike her brethren, she could not perform a dragon form summoning, either. All of this would also be used against her by the people who regularly bullied her. Her family eventually decided for her to always stay indoors, shut off from the outside world. It was through this that she eventually found her main hobby: Smithing.

Misa found great enjoyment in creating all sorts of armor and weaponry, which would then be used by her family, or sold to other clans (who did not know who made them, but were very impressed by the quality), this was the beginning of **Unissix Crafts**, her little workshop/store. Expressing her creativity through it helped a lot to keep her thoughts away from all that was happening outside, and she felt much more relaxed.

With time, and as she kept improving her skills, she found interest in greater challenges, such as far more complex weaponry than mere blades and others. To satisfy this desire, her family would bring to her books on "weapons of legend", which the young Misa managed to replicate almost to perfection, much to the surprise of all. She was quite proud of what she had achieved, and this further boosted her popularity, which resulted in personal requests for many of those replicas to be made.

In 2016, the Unissix Clan received the visit of a **Nukuri** woman, **Zanaveth Nekuraku II**, who wished to study their culture and history. She was welcomed to stay at their home for as long as she wanted, as it was quite rare for them to have any visitors, and they were also intrigued by this individual from a species they had never seen before. During her stay, she'd eventually get to meet Misa, and would frequently watch her work. Misa initially felt quite shy around this odd white-as-snow woman who had appeared so suddenly, but as the days passed, and they got to interact more, they became quite close.

One morning, Misa's parents were given some surprising news. Zanaveth II wished to marry their daughter, and bring her to her homeworld, citing that she'd be much safer by her side. They very happily agreed to this proposition, and thanked her for what she had done. Ever since that day, Misa has never left Zanaveth II's side, always being with her, wherever she went. In 2042, during a stay on Earth with a mutual friend, the two had a child, **Zanaveth Nekuraku III**.

Although Misa was quite happy living with her wife, there was a major issue that popped up once she had moved in to **Nahkami** with her: Her identity. Around that time, the **Yathai Empire** was known to have a very negative \cf[ed. note: more like "murdery"]\c- stance on what the emperor saw as "degeneracy". Knowing that Misa would potentially be executed just like other members of family had been in the past, Zanaveth II had to ensure that the fact her wife was transgender was kept secret, much to her discomfort, having to then publicly present as male to the whole world, and additionally being unable to receive any treatment.

In 2068, When WW7 broke out, the two, along with their child, took the chance to flee to **Sankaideriha**, the island of magic. There, Zanaveth II introduced Misa to a certain alchemist, **Archmage Kounan**, who was famous for providing what was known popularly as "magic-based HRT". For Misa, this was nothing short of miraculous, as in a matter of minutes, she would find herself in a body she could call her own, all solely by drinking one potion.

Misa and her wife stayed in the island until 2108, when they were notified about the end of the war, along with the fall of the empire, and the rise of a more fair and welcoming society. These were wonderful news for them, and after saying their goodbyes to the people of the land of magic, they returned home. Ever since then, and with Zanaveth II being elected as "Minister of Interspecies Relations", the two now travel around the world together.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWehhhhhh, Misa-Misa, you damn cutie...\c-

\cfShe really is the sweetest lil' cinnamon roll, I tell ya. Just seeing her smile melts my goddamn heart. Right next to Zana-sama they're both a full combo of maximum cuteness.\c-

\cfIt's kinda sad to read on how things used to be a long time ago, but at the same time I'm also really happy that everything got better for them. Bless Zana-sama with that timely rescue there, like, from what I heard, all that awful bullying was REALLY getting to her, poor thing. Zana-sama talks about it a lot, the night she confessed to her, and how she begged for her to take her away from that hellhole. She's a goddamn angel, that gal.\c-

\cf*sigh* You know, I'm kind of a sucker for romantic stories like these (don't tell anyone pls).\c-

\cfOh yeah, also Misa is one hell of a pro gamer, holy shit. Anything I got her to play, she would just blaze through like it was nothing. Yeah, even THOSE games. It's fun to watch her, and she's specially fond of adventure stuff, I guess because it's the kinda thing she could never do irl.\c-

\cfAlso, funny story. The first time I visited them when they were in Sankaideriha, Misa gave me one hell of a scare with that sudden transformation she went through. It's like... she was a completely different person entirely. Like, I had never seen her so happy before, it was really something else, and honestly I was also happy for her too. Ah, and then that other thing happened, when uhhh... we went to a hot springs together. I... accidentally... saw... down there, yeah...\c-

\cfGod, no wonder I could hear Zana-sama across the house when they'd go at it. Ah... you lucky devil...\c-

\cfYes, that was when they were staying at my place. They're not the first I hear do it like wild beasts, actually. Yu-chan and that big tiddy goth gf of hers, they're quite something too. Seriously, no one knows that from my bedroom you can perfectly hear whatever's happening in the guest room. Dunno why, some sort of acoustics fuckery or something, but yeah.\c-

\cf(I wish I could unhear the unholy noises Taro-niisan emitted when he brought Ellen-san, though)\c-
