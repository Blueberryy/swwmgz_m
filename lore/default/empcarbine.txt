The **EMP Rail Carbine** is **Tach-Engine**'s very first attempt at combining existing human technology with the retrieved experiments from their expedition to the ruined headquarters of **Decade Mechanics**. Akin to typical particle-beam weaponry, but with a boost of thundering, highly destructive exotic matter, it has been deemed far superior even to the mighty **Thunder Buster** so well-prized by UAC troops.

Unexpectedly, the Rail Carbine is a tube fed bolt-action rifle, which employs shielded rods of pure **Dysedum**. Each of these allowing the weapon to discharge guided 20kA pulses towards an ionized target, frying it in an instant, and potentially spreading its deadly effects to others nearby.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Hold to emit a faint ionizing charge towards the aimed spot. The longer this is held, the more accurate the shot will be. Release to discharge the beam. If the rod has been depleted, cycle the bolt to load a new one.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Also emits an ionizing charge, but does not discharge on release. Useful if you can't guarantee your target will always be in sight, or if you want to quickly mark several targets.

\cfReloading:\c- More rods can be fed into the weapon as needed, up to a maximum of three.

\cfTechniques:\c- By ionizing several targets you can guarantee that the beam will branch out into lesser arcs and strike them all, though the damage potential will be divided among them.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYou know, anything that dabs on the UAC with its mere existence is good in my book.\c-

\cfThis thing, though, also gets bonus points for its sheer pants-shittingly intense potential to deep fry sons of bitches. Seriously, it's like actual fucking lightning shooting out of this.\c-
