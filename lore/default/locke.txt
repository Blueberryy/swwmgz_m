**Janus Locke** is the younger brother of the late **Dr. Häzel Hoodth** known by many as the **Mad Doctor of Kereshnovka**. After hearing the news of Häzel's death in 1987 (specifically, receiving them 10 years after the fact, while he was studying abroad), in an oil rig explosion near the town while he was performing an experiment to "obtain the essence of immortality", Locke changed entirely. He decided to continue his brother's work, while at the same time still maintaining his current job as a toy maker. However, the madness into which he fell would extend even to that, with the various products that would come out under his brand of **Dr. Locke's Wonderful Toys** becoming increasingly dangerous, or even outright lethal.

His insanity peaked in 2049, when he attempted to "take over the world". This event, however, backfired so spectacularly that afterwards he completely disappeared from the public eye. Once he was gone, the various deadly toys he had made found new life being resold as actual weapons in many online marketplaces.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfSo, yeah... guy's totally a lost case. aaaaall screws loose. But yeah, as you could read there, those "toys" of his, they're quite reliable weapons, so I got my hands on some of 'em and put them in your arsenal (wait, that sounds wrong if you don't read that last word in full, doesn't it).\c-

\cfJust in case, you better be REALLY careful with these things. Who knows... shit could probably backfire catastrophically at any moment, JUST LIKE HIS PLANS FOR WORLD DOMINATION DID WWWWWWWWWWWW\c-
