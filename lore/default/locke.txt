Full Name: Janus Locke Hoodth
Nationality: Qurensniv
Date of Birth: 1980-07-30

Summary: Younger brother of Häzel Hoodth, the "mad doctor" of Kereshnovka known for his inhuman experiments in order to search for the "essence of immortality". The young man changed entirely after Häzel's death in 1987, in an oil rig explosion near the town. While trying to follow on his brother's steps, on the side he also runs "Dr. Locke's Wonderful Toys" in order to earn some cash, although not many people really buy said toys, since they are hilariously deadly. In 2049 he attempted to "take over the world", an event that backfired so hilariously he completely disappeared from the public eye afterwards.

Saya's Note: Guy's a total nut, but these "toys" are very reliable weapons for you. Just be careful when using them, shit could backfire catastrophically at any moment, who knows...
