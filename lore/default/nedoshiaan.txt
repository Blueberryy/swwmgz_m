Name: Nedoshiaan
Classification: Dead Planet
Location: Undisclosed

Summary: A dead world once belonging to a mad dictator of the same name. The stories say that he was slain by one of his own most trusted associates, in a suicidal attack, and the resulting blast is what originated the massive crater that reaches deep into the planet's frozen core. An expedition by Devanikan adventurers resulted in the discovery of several artifacts at the very bottom of the crater, the so-called "Artifacts of Nedoshiaan", weapons designed for the ultimate destruction. Currently, these are still in possession of the Dragonblood Clan head family, and their use and reproduction is tightly controlled.

Addendum: Of all the four artifacts, two of them were successfully replicated by Misa Unissix. But only one has been deemed acceptable for use, as the other operates under circumstances that make it a crime against all life.

Saya's Note: Gosh... finding out more stuff about alien worlds out there, the universe is so much bigger than we ever knew... it's just... feckin' mindblowing, this stuff. Also props to Misa for letting us use one of those guns. Shit's better than the UAC's prized BFG.
