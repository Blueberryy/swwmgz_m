Ever since its creation by **Professor Eushura Kmonn Jr.**, the **Ray-Khom** has taken a permanent spot in every **Xekkian** soldier's loadout. Reliable, efficient, needing little to no maintenance due to lacking any moving parts beyond its feeding mechanism. Ammunition is additionally quite easy to come by, at least locally, as exports carry with them heavy taxing.

The weapon is powered entirely by a compact quad-cell Korberon-Eneiebium battery pack, easy to replace when needed. Ammunition is fed from 20-round magazines. The ammunition itself, slim 40mm caseless magnetized bolts, fitted with a hyperdense Dyratin ignition charge, releasing potent discharges of ultra-high temperature plasma on impact, capable of melting quickly through anything short of high resonant Almasteel plating and causing strong, stinging burns to Xekkian skin (or severe corrosion of muscle and bone tissue to anything weaker).

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Steady shooting, quick and precise. Minimal recoil due to the electromagnetic operation, mostly quiet as the projectiles are shot ever so slightly below the speed of sound. Your enemies are guaranteed to not take notice of your attacks until it's too late.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Engages the concentrated pulse emitters along the weapon's blades, emitting a potent discharge of electricity in front of the user, temporarily stunning anything that stands too close. May cause death on weak targets. It is recommended to only use this sparingly, as it drains the battery quickly.

\cfPrimary Reload:\c- Reloads the weapon.

\cfSecondary Reload:\c- Swaps the battery. This action can only be performed once the charge is low enough, as it would be wasteful otherwise.

\cfTechniques:\c- Secondary fire increases in lethality if used on conductive liquids such as water. Just make sure to not be standing in it yourself.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfTHAT'S FUCKING HUGE, HOLY SHIT!\c-

\cfSo by Xekkian standards this is a "light weapon", really now??? It's a good thing that your hands can somehow adapt to the grip of this thing, because holy fucking hell...\c-

\cfThis shit is like, where do I start. It's some serious fucking ass destroyer, that's what. Out of all the stuff in your arsenal, I'd say this is the second strongest weapon we've got. Misa actually delivered it herself way back when, and then we had a talk with the old man from Tach-Engine to have it available for purchase, since he does have that deal going with Kmonn and all (I'm pretty sure what those two have is more than just a business partnership, if you know what I mean).\c-

\cfWhen she came through the door lugging that thing around on her shoulders I knew it had to be ours.\c-
