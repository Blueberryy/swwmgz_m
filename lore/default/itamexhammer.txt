Strong, reliable, and packing a mighty wallop, the **Reinforced Combat Hammer** from **Itamex Military Supplies** has become a staple weapon for the most serious of **EDF** operatives. Thanks to the usage of Itamex's highest grade proprietary alloys, said to be ten times stronger than tungsten carbide with only twice the density, this slamming tool can withstand endless hours of action without ever wearing down.

The Reinforced Combat Hammer is primarily meant to be used in quickly dismantling barricades or tearing down reinforced barriers, but many have taken to more creative uses, such as in the destruction of armored vehicles, or improvised demolition work of whole buildings. It should also be noted that in actual combat it can prove to be very lethal (and bloody) against unarmored targets.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Rapid swings, from side to side. Good for quickly plowing through enemy hordes.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Hold to ready up a vertical swing, release to let the hammer drop on whatever poor fool is standing in front of you. The longer you hold, the stronger the hit.

\cfTertiary Fire:\c- Hold to ready up a wide horizontal swing, release to perform a potent spin attack, smashing away everything around you. Consecutive presses of tertiary fire while spinning will keep the motion going for longer. Being a combat robot, you should be free from any motion sickness that a human would typically develop while performing this action.

\cfReloading:\c- It's a sledgehammer. There's no reloading, go bash some skulls.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfShit's strong AND good. Perfect for a Demolitionist such as yourself, huhu. And you know what else is good? It can be even MORE powerful once you pop a Ragekit. You'll become UNSTOPPABLE.\c-

\cfOh yeah! Hammer time!\c-
