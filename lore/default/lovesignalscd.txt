Released in 2020 to critical acclaim, **Love Signals** is the debut album of AI idol **Meidobot**, created in 2017 by **Akari Labs**. It's been described as a "declaration of love" from the idol to her creator, **Saya Miyamoto**.

\cfTrack Listing:\c-
  1. A Song From the Heart
  2. Synthetic Romance
  3. Binding Pulse
  4. Do Robots Dream of Electric Love
  5. Algorithm of Desire
  6. Compile my Feelings
  7. Love Signals

The album is a collaborative effort between Meidobot herself and the various independent artists that have made their fame composing melodies for her to sing to. Its beginning track, the unfairly sweet **A Song From the Heart**, remained at the top of several rankings for many years since its release, gaining even more fame after it was revisited in Meidobot's fifth album, **Love, Robots, and Everything Between** (2043), with **Ashley Knox** of the British band **Black Rat's Coven** singing alongside her.

\cfIt's so good, her singing voice... Getting her into this whole thing, of being an idol, one of my best ideas ever. Even if J-Pop isn't 100% my kinda thing, I still love it because it's her, and I love her, so much...\c-

\cfHeh, did you know that when we were first dating she would sometimes personally serenade me? God, that was so cliched, but I loved it. Wish she'd still do that, but she's not really into singing anymore ever since she retired, long before you were born. Maybe if the two of us get together for this we could convince her, wouldn't you think?\c-
