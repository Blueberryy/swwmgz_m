The **Ynykron (Divine Fury)** is a high power energy weapon capable of efficiently erasing any living entities struck by its beam shot, both organic or artificial, stopping only once it hits a sufficiently solid surface.

In its original incarnation, built by **Nukurines Mei Mess** during his time serving as lead engineer of **Nedoshiaan**'s empire, it could stand to even destroy the physical bodies of deities. As ammunition, it employed the concentrated energy extracted from slaves who had undergone years of constant torture, their suffering acting as fuel to bring forth this "Divine Fury".

When it was retrieved from the depths of the dead planet along with the other artifacts, it fell into the hands of the **Unissix Clan**, and by extension, **Misa Unissix**.

Misa had a lot of interest in weapons of legend, specifically, in making her own versions of them, so she saw this as a new challenge for her skills. Although at first she hit a wall due to the inability to dismantle and properly reverse engineer it, she eventually managed to get her hands on the original blueprints of the artifact, thanks to her grandfather from her father's side, **Nekorosen Nerukousei**, who was an old friend of Mei Mess.

The replica Ynykron uses a highly volatile mixture of exotic elements, in stable crystalized form, with considerable destructive power once a simple beam of light is directed through it. Misa sees this as a more "ethically reasonable" alternative to the intended ammunition of the original, additionally having the benefit of being easy to manufacture with the right materials and time.

It should be noted that this weapon's usage is highly restricted. Special permission from a member of the Unissix clan is required.

\cfPrimary Fire:\c- Charges the shot. Once complete, pulling the trigger releases it.

\cfSecondary Fire:\c- Reorients the ammo box, allowing for an alternate fire mode. A "vortex shot", a concentrated negative energy void that will pull in everything around itself for a short time, tearing it apart with strong tidal forces. It is generally not recommended to ever use this.

\cfReloading:\c- If the weapon is charging, or ready for shooting, this will be cancelled and no ammunition will be used, but the weapon will have to vent for a while. Otherwise, a new crystal is loaded.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfSometimes I wonder if Misa actually realizes the dangers of the stuff she makes. This thing... it's maybe a bit too much, you know... Even compared to all the other stuff in the arsenal. I still ended up accepting it, anyway, because you know how I am, and how cute Misa is. I can't say no to that face.\c-

\cfSo yeah, here it is, "God's Cumshot" in all its glory. A motherfucking blast of blinding whiteness that just... absolutely fucking obliterates everything it's aimed at. Sure is a weapon, huh?\c-

\cfAlso, that alternate mode... I know you'll probably do it anyway out of curiosity. Just... be careful, okay?\c-
