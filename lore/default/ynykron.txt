Designation: Ynykron Artifact ("Death Cannon")
Manufacturer: Unknown, replicated by Unissix Crafts

Summary: One of the four ancient artifacts of war created for the mad dictator god Nedoshiaan. The Death Cannon uses an extremely volatile cocktail of exotic materials in order to tear through the fabric of existence. Two modes of operation exist depending on the orientation of its ammo box.

Primary Fire: Charges a beam shot. Once complete, pulling the trigger releases it. The beam will instantly destroy everything in its way, no matter how tough it is.

Secondary Fire: Charges a vortex shot. Once complete, pulling the trigger releases it. On the impact area a miniature black hole will be created which will swallow everything around itself for a period of time before collapsing in a devastating explosion.

Reloading: If there's any ongoing charge process, it will be cancelled and no ammunition will be used, but the weapon will have to vent for a while. Otherwise, loads a new crystal.

Addendum: Only the one original instance of this weapon should exist, but replicas have begun to surface thanks to reverse engineering efforts. Still, use of this weapon is considered illegal without proper authorization. Luckily for you, you are authorized to use it against the invading forces.
