**Mixom** is the world's largest supplier of industrial equipment, with almost worldwide coverage (extending even beyond Earth thanks to their long time partnership and dealings with the **UAC**, having produced most of their basic equipment and infrastructure). The only ones stopping them from fully dominating the market are the Australian **Symnatek** and the Scottish **Tach-Engine Technologies**, along with their one direct competitor, **Moxim**.

The conflicts between Mixom and Moxim very often make the news, due to their rapidly escalating "lawsuit wars" over who delivers the best quality for a certain product.

Mixom is, in addition, one of the last bastions of capitalism remaining in the country of Japan since the major reforms done by the **Japanese Communist Party** in 2048.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfMoney and power, absolute dominance, bullshit capitalism. Disgusting... I hope they all explode.\c-

\cfYou can't take two steps without coming across something made by them, they are FUCKING EVERYWHERE. Like, for example, all the screws in your body? Mixom branded. The liquid cooling? Also Mixom... I could keep going, but it makes me feel gross saying their name so often.\c-
