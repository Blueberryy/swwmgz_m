Name: Mixom Tools
Classification: Industrial Equipment Manufacturer
Location: Japan

Summary: The largest supplier of industrial equipment on Earth, with coverage almost worldwide (excluding Australia, Symnatek's home turf). They're long time partners with the UAC, having produced most of their basic equipment and infrastructure.

Addendum: Mixom has a rival company known as Moxim, who often claims to provide superior products. They frequently make the news due to attempts to sue each other over this.

Saya's Note: You can't walk two steps without seeing the Mixom logo on something. They are fucking everywhere... Hell, all the screws in your body are Mixom branded.
