The **JetBurst™ Impulsor** is one of the very first truly portable jetpack units, being not only lightweight but also efficient in its fuel usage. This device allows the user to perform "boosts" in mid-air, and also rapid dashes and dodges in any direction, further enhancing their mobility on any situation. It should be noted that for its adequate operation, it's recommended to wear protective clothing, otherwise, harm may come to the wearer from extended use (this is not necessary for exosuits or power armor, along with autonomous robots, however).

Thanks to its patented self-regenerating fuel cells, the unit is guaranteed to remain available for use for many years, needing only a constant supply of hydrogen (which may even come from just the air around itself).

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYou know, Ibuki used to have one of these too, back when she was in America doing all that stuff she was supposed to (and afterwards). She could fly and pull other crazy stunts and whatnot, but I guess you really can't, actually. I mean, I'm not exactly calling you fat or anything... but... well, you do weight 500kg, that is a fact.\c-

\cfSeriously... had I known almasteel is that heavy, I wouldn't have used such thick plating on your body, like, I kinda did say I wanted it "EXTRA THICC" when Misa asked me, as a bit of a meme, but she really took it way too seriously.\c-

\cf*sigh* If you were a bit lighter, I totally could have had you sit on my lap during that Q&A livestream. Ahhhhh, damn it...\c-
