Designation: Forx JetBurst Impulsor
Manufacturer: Forx Aeronautics

Summary: A portable, efficient jetpack unit. Allows the user to perform short "boosts" in mid air, can also be used for rapid dashing and dodging. It is recommended to wear protective clothing to prevent damage from extended use (this is not necessary if you are a robot).

Addendum: Its fuel supply will regenerate over time when not in use.

Saya's Note: Ibuki used to carry one of these too, but you won't be able to do all that crazy flying, you're a bit too heavy for all that. I wish I had used lighter materials to build you, then I could've had you sit on my lap during that Q&A session...
