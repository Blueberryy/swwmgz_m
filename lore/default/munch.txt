Initially starting its days producing smart appliances for home use, **Munch Innovations** suddenly entered the weapons market without a second thought after **Parker Munch**, son of company founder **Allen Munch** and well-known gun enthusiast, made the decision to acquire all the research material and patents on a new plastic explosive known as **Explodium**.

Following the success of Parker's **Explodium Gun**, he went on to announce an "invent as many guns as I can in one week" challenge on his Twitter, furthermore going through each and every one of the various designs he'd come up with. Not many of those succeeded, although a much more powerful (albeit dangerous) new model of the Explodium Gun did gain some recognition (mainly among people crazy enough to want to use it).

Many of the designs that did succeed would enter the market under the Munch Innovations brand, however, and sell like hotcakes, especially on US territory.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfGotta love how in this day and age, pretty much anyone can start making guns. I mean, for those american idiots, it's not unexpected, but yeah.\c-

\cfAlso is it just me or... that guy's name sounds hella familiar? I swear, I've heard that name before... or something similar, maybe? If my brain wasn't so scrambled from living this long I'd remember it right away, fml.\c-
