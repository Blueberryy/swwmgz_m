Full Name: Munch Innovations
Classification: Arms Manufacturer
Location: Texas

Summary: The Munch Innovations name applies to everything created by a very reclusive man, originating from a livetweeted "invent as many guns as I can in one week" challenge. Although most of them were quickly discarded, some of the weapons earned enough attention from various industry giants to enter mass production, the only requirement from the man was to be credited as the original creator.

Addendum: Not much else is known about the man other than his name, "Parker Munch".

Saya's Note: Why does this guy's name sound so familiar...
