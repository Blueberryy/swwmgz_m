Name: Blackmann Arms Ltd.
Classification: Arms Designer and Manufacturer
Location: Cologne, Germany

Summary: Founded in 1924 by Daniel Ischer as "Schwarzmann Exotischwaffen", an "exotic weapons" workshop in Cologne. Their slogan is "if you can imagine it, we can build it". Rose to fame when the family escaped to America in 1933. After settling in, the shop "americanized" itself under the current brand of "Blackmann Arms", and quickly rose to fame designing all sorts of ingenious weaponry for the allied forces. During WW3 they moved back to Germany, where they've stayed to this day. The company is currently run by Hermann E. Ischer, great-great-grandson of the original founder, who has made it a personal goal that as long as any commissioned weapon can hold more than one bullet, it must have a built-in function for shooting everything as quickly as possible.

Addendum: A big part of the company's funding comes from Mr. BIG SHOT Industries, which according to reports by Hermann himself, regularly commissions all sorts of ludicrous shotgun designs that no sane man would think of using. Out of all these strictly private commissions, one sole weapon was eventually made public, the "Wallbuster", a 25-barrel revolving shotgun.

Saya's Note: I think I cracked the code here... if the company's name references what I think it does... Oh come on. Did the founder seriously intend people to think of his DICK whenever they looked at the massive guns he made? GROSS.
