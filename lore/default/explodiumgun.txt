Designation: Explodium Gun
Manufacturer: Munch Innovations

Summary: Semi-automatic handgun designed for custom-made .387 caliber Explodium tipped bullets. Highly volatile, can clear lesser targets with ease. Each magazine holds 7 rounds.

Primary Fire: Slow, accurate shooting. A direct hit is often lethal, but the splash damage can deal some fine hurt too. Aim at the feet to send smaller enemies flying.

Secondary Fire: Performs an "explosive reload", pulling the pin on the mag to arm it as a grenade and throw it at enemies. Its yield is proportional to the number of bullets left inside. This action can only be performed when you have at least one bullet still left.

Reloading: Normal reload, nothing will explode here.

Addendum: Thanks to a deal between Akari Labs and Munch Innovations, you have been provided with a practically limitless supply of ammunition for this weapon, so feel free to waste away.

Saya's Note: This one's on my main, level three-eighty-seven... Eeeh? What do you mean you don't get that reference?
