Designation: Hellfire Cannon Mk3 ("Hellblazer")
Manufacturer: Imanaki Research Corporation

Summary: Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher of simple design. Four types of ammunition are available, all of them powered by highly condensed "Hell Energy". Standard grenades are pretty much what anyone would expect, Crackshots burst into a cluster of smaller grenades, Ravagers release hellish flames on a wide area, and last but not least, Warheads devastate everything in a large radius, including yourself if you don't keep your distance.

Primary Fire: Shoots the loaded ammunition with its propulsion armed and ready.

Secondary Fire: Lobs the loaded ammunition unarmed, as a bouncing grenade.

Tertiary Fire: Selects the ammo type for the next reload.

Reloading: Reloads, obviously. Any ammo switches will be done here, any unused ammo that doesn't fit back into the inventory will be dropped on the ground.

Addendum: The rockets automatically detonate on proximity with hostile targets, so even if your aim is slightly off you will still land a hit.
