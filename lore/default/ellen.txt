Full Name: Elena "Ellen" Yanikov XVI
Nationality: American
Date of Birth: 2066-06-06

Summary: Ellen is the current youngest member of a long-running lineage of immortal mischievous maidens all named "Elena Yanikov", started by the first daughter of Erana Yanikov in 1703. She is an avid urban explorer, and spent most of her teenage years scavenging the wasteland of the former United States after WW3. This is how she eventually got to meet Ibuki Miyamoto, and through her, Taro Miyamoto, who is now her husband.

Addendum: Within Ellen's family, only the women seem to inherit immortality, all the men eventually grow old and die. Ellen is distantly related to Gothic Rock singer/guitarist Ashley Knox, as her father, Gottfried Steiner, is the grandson of her ex-husband. She also is one quarter demon through her grandfather, Cytho Valathor.

Saya's Note: She's such a troll sometimes... When she pranks ya, she goes HARD. My ass is still sore from last time. Hm? What happened? Ah... it's too embarrassing to talk about...
