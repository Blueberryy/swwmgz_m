Name: Anarukon
Classification: Immortal beings
Location: Various

Summary: The Anarukon are a race of immortal beings created by a god known as Noskas Kurenai (in their tongue, "Father of Eternity"). They are entirely unkillable, able to recover even if burned to ashes. While most of the population is in the Empire of Novoskhana, other groups split off from it following major disagreements with the empire's policies.

Addendum: The Anarukon are the humanoid race with the highest ratio of individuals who don't conform to the sex or gender binaries according to a recent census. Approximately 40% of the population falls under the "intersex" classification, and only 30% of the total population could be considered "cisgender". A study by Mosse Anderken traced this to a mutation in the Anarukon genome that appeared many years after the creation of the empire.

Saya's Note: More stuff about gods here. Really not joking around, they ARE real.

While most of the population is in the Empire of Novoskhana, other groups split off from it following major disagreements with the empire's policies. Among them the most notable are the Eternal Kingdom, founded by Noskas Kurenai himself and led by Queen Andreki Anderken, and the Rust Empire, founded by Syrakha Yanikov and led by Child Emperor Kirin Xanai.

Saya's Note: You know... I met Andreki once, after my wedding with Kirin-kun. I seriously thought she was just a little kid, god damn that was embarrassing... I also met some of her relatives, like this witchy looking lady... her aunt I think? I couldn't stare at her for too long, it made me anxious. T-there was also uhhh... her mom, really hardcore looking badass gutsy warrior mommy, another aunt who apparently likes to go around in a creepy costume and uses a voice changer to sound all evil, she was the most fun to talk to. I also met the GOD in all caps himself, the "Father of Eternity"... oh boy the tension when he was looking at me... but it was fine because turns out he's a real softly lol. Ahhh... it was so fun finally getting to meet these people after having only ever read about them, and oh boy don't even get me started on what it's like to be married to one, huhu. Finally, an immortal cutie just for me... and hot daaaamn he's a big cutie... and a beast in bed, uheheheheheh~
