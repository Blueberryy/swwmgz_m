These ancient relics were encountered while exploring the ancient alien ruins in Sedna, near the portal to the **Xathar system**. Unlike many other findings in this exploration, these ones in particular gave a potential hint to the origins of all this. The specific shape of the relics, that of the Egyptian Ankh, symbol of life, came as a revelation to the founder of the **Tach-Engine Technology Institute**, who led this expedition. He theorized that these ruins might have been part of a "staging area" that his antecessors could have used when they first came to Earth, to found their colony in Egypt.

This specific artifact, called **Refresher**, has strong rejuvenating effects, much more potent than those of other similar healing devices previously discovered. Any wounds or afflictions are instantly healed once the artifact is held tightly against someone's chest. Like with the others, the nature of these effects is entirely unknown, and **J.A. Tachmek-Smith** himself has dedicated most of his time to research.

One important, additional characteristic of the Refresher is the fact that it somehow has the ability to "automatically activate" its healing effects, should an individual carrying it be in immediate danger of death. Even so, its effect may not be potent enough to prevent such an outcome in all cases.
