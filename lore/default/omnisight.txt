The **Omnisight** is a programmable plugin device for the **Demolitionist** that can provide the unit with mapping data for the current area. Not only can it provide a general outline for their internal area map, but also additional information for the targetting array, such as the location of key items (in most cases literal keys), and also the position and distance to the nearest exits.

Omnisight devices can be easily filled in by surveying operators thanks to **Akari Labs**'s specialized software and hardware tools, and are readily compatible with most major Linux distributions. Drivers for other platforms can be downloaded from the Akari Labs website, though their stability is not guaranteed.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfJust so you know, a lot of people risk their lives filling in the data for these things, so you better pay some respects whenever you come across one. They may be volunteers, but their lives are as valuable as anyone else's.\c-
