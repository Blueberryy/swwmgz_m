Name: X'Animen Coalition
Classification: Solar System Cluster
Location: Various Galaxies

Summary: X'Animen is the name of a group of planetary systems, comprising several inhabited worlds, all connected through portals. During the first days following the "Luna Event", it was discovered that our own solar system had a portal connecting to them, in the remote dwarf planet of Sedna, from which the Nukuri had come to our world in order to study us as potential candidates for joining the group. The current member systems are Xathar (where the Nukuri homeworld is), Zenna, Mondakan and Kryudon.

Addendum: Things aren't always peaceful in here. Several members are prone to waging war among themselves, or fighting over the nonexistent leadership of the Coalition.

Saya's Note: Interplanetary alliances... man... all this stuff is just like something out of a sci-fi novel, and it's cool and all. I hope that one day we can be part of all this. Could've happened sooner, but, y'know, stuff happened... *sigh*
