Name: Onoke Mansion Murders
Classification: Unsolved murder mystery
Location: Kereshnovka

Summary: In October of 2003, a fire broke out in the Onoke Mansion, on the outskirts of Kereshnovka, during a meeting between the Imanaki and Onoke families. When the firefighters arrived, they found everyone dead, all having been murdered in increasingly gruesome ways. The culprit was never found.

Addendum: Initially, because the family's head servant was never found, some suspected he may have been responsible, but much later his body (or what was left of it) was found in the woods nearby, with his face shredded into an unrecognizable mess.

Saya's Note: Gruesome, huh? Honestly it's not even close to that other murder mystery from the 80's, the one about witches and shit. For this one some crazy cult stuff is more likely, considering the location.
