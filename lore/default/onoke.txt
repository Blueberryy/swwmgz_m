In October of 2003, a fire broke out in the **Onoke Mansion**, at the outskirts of **Kereshnovka**, during a meeting between the **Imanaki** and **Onoke** families. When the firefighters arrived, they found everyone dead, all having been murdered in increasingly gruesome ways. The culprit was never found.
There are many theories about what could have happened. Most point towards this having been the work of **Hynnykka the Great Witch**, a serial killer from centuries ago (or a possible successor), remarking on the fact that her last note could have the potential interpretation of having been directed towards these two powerful families ("everyone will die"). This is not only seen as a considerable stretch, but there are clear doubts that something like this could have been done by a single individual.

Another theory points to ritual suicide, though there would be no clear explanation for why such a thing would be done in the first place. Both families were in quite good standing, and this reunion had been in celebration of the marriage between two of their members, marking the start of a very beneficial partnership.

Many other theories, each increasingly wilder and crazier than the last, mention possibilities such as attacks by cultists, the town's ghouls, or some sort of clearly planned assassination by rival families (of which none are actually known).

To this day, no one knows exactly what had happened then, and the case remains unsolved. Only one person survived this, **Tetsuya Imanaki**, CEO of **Imanaki Corp**, but solely because he had been absent from the event.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfSome real shit in there, huh? I gotta say it's not as exciting as that one other murder mystery from the 80's, the one that happened here in Japan. Yeah, I still remember that shit, the theorizing and other nonsensical craziness about it took a while to die down. People actually still went on about it when I was a kid. I especially remember the meme about "small bombs" or some shit. It was a dumb meme theory but Taro and I thought it was really funny.\c-

\cfOh yeah, that one gal from Ashley-san's band, Mykka, she was also all over it, being a self-professed "detective" and all. She was one of the few who pretty much pushed hard for all of it being the work of witches. Yeah, when you're one yourself that's what you'd go with, heh...\c-
