A soft and huggable doll of the great hero **Demolitionist**, savior of Earth, slayer of Demons, exploder of knees. Caringly crafted by **Nukritas 2xx** herself, this plush doll features quite the attention to detail, sporting a self-illuminating face and glowing tags, just like the real thing! (Jetpacks are not functional, however)

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfWell look at that, you're getting famous, Demo-chan. Yeah, even abroad, too. Heard those two have been marketing this stuff pretty heavily out there, heh... Bet Zana-sama has one, she'd definitely do, I know she's all about cute cuddly things (like Misa).\c-

\cfBut really... this is so cute, just... wanna squeeze it and kiss it and... God, I hope you finish up this mission soon.\c-
