Summary: The Doom Marine is the lone survivor of the demonic invasions on the UAC bases of Phobos and Deimos, and is seen as kind of a legendary figure by many. Due to his impressive track record he has also been appointed as the organization's "problem solver". At the moment of writing this, he has been tasked with fighting the demon invaders on Earth.

Addendum: You have been ordered to not interact with this man, if you encounter him, please stand back and let him work.

Saya's Note: Sorry about the lack of info here, those UAC goons really keep it well-guarded. At least I heard he likes bunnies, so if the worst happens just pretend to be one and he might not shoot you on sight.
