One of the most ingenious creations of **Cyrus Enterprises**, the **Hammerspace™** container is a small device that fits in a pocket and allows one to have access to their own off-world storage space, with the ability to deposit and withdraw any item from it at will, in the blink of an eye. It has been often compared to the **Bag of Holding**, as known by many a roleplay enthusiast, and even the head of the company has confirmed that it was indeed the main inspiration for this device. He sees it as a way to "finally bring videogame inventory mechanics to real life".

It has been noted that Hammerspace™ containment cannot be used for living beings. No clear explanation has been given as to why, other than "it will void the warranty".

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfVidya inventory system, good, handy, sure. I even got myself TWO contracts, so you get one space for all your guns and other junk, and another entirely for ammo. I don't know how big these things actually are like... physically speaking, but with two of them you definitely will have enough to carry a lot of shit. Enough firepower to beat up whatever you come across. Hell, there's even a way to expand the ammo storage if you really want more, actually. You'll see.\c-

\cfOh yeah, also: NEEEEEEEEEEEEEERD.\c-

\cf"Hammerspace"? Really? Goddamn stinky nerd has to be a stinky nerd at naming everything, huh?\c-
