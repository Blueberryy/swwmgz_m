Designation: Pocket Hammerspace Container
Manufacturer: Cyrus Enterprises

Summary: These devices provide the carrier with access to a dedicated off-world storage space, with practically instant deposit and withdraw times. You have been provided with two separate spaces, one for your items and weapons, and one entirely dedicated to carried ammunition.

Addendum: Use of Hammerspace containment for storing living beings is not allowed and will immediately void your warranty.

Saya's Note: This sounds like something out of a videogame, it's cool, sure, but did that stinky nerd really have to be a stinky nerd and call it "Hammerspace"?
