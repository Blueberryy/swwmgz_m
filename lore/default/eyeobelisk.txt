Unearthed from the crystal mines of the **Golden Vale** in the far ends of **Parthoris**, this odd artifact of unknown creator hovers about, waiting for a hand to touch it. Those who have had it on their grasp recall being assaulted by rapidly flashing images, said to be vague glimpses into a grim future. What is shown seems to vary depending on the observer.

Following a first discovery, more were later found, deeper into the caverns. Of those, one is in the hands of the **Tach-Engine Technology Institute**, who are currently studying it, in order to ascertain its true nature.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfI puked out my guts when I touched that fucking thing. No, seriously, what even WAS that. I saw all sorts of fucked up shit, straight out of my nightmares, and also people I didn't recognize, in really weird places. Also the screaming, holy fuck the screaming. I can still hear it, even though this was like... days ago.\c-

\cfAnyway, if you're reading this that means you got it out of one of those two's damn "chanceboxes". Well, whatever you saw will be neatly recorded in your brain, so we can easily extract it and analyze it later, which is pretty neat. Just... I hope it didn't give you too hard of a scare. You'll get ALL the hugs when the mission's over, I promise.\c-
