This very specific tasty sandwich has been masterfully crafted by the co-founder of the **University of Nos-Kora** to give absolutely anyone the most wonderful boost in health. It also provides them with all the protection they could ever want.

Do not be deceived by its simple appearance, this edible artifact is imbued with the power of **Nukritas 1xx** himself, and not only does provide its consumer with the benefits previously mentioned, but also allows itself to be eaten by those with the physical inability to do so, through sheer force of will.

Even if not directly eaten, the sandwich can still prove useful at other moments. For as long as it stays in your possession, it may even disperse its energy on the very moment of your ultimate demise, completely canceling it. You truly can never be without this wondrous artifact.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, these guys write the entries for their own stuff, easy to tell, I know. I don't even know anymore, anything related to them completely fries my brain trying to understand what's happening. Like, when we first tested this stuff, remember?\c-

\cfThe two just, popped up at the labs out of nowhere and offered this "sandwich" to us, and no matter how much I insisted that you couldn't eat it, they kept going on and on about how it was all you needed and shit. And then, THAT happened. OK so, I know it was confusing for you too, but I was watching it all in full, and let me tell you, I felt like reality was falling apart around me, like... nothing made sense anymore. The fact that you somehow ATE the sandwich, and I could see it happening, and then the flash of light, and all that stuff and... fucking hell... I don't know what to think anymore.\c-

\cfThese Nos-Kora crazies, really, they just drive me up the wall with this stupid shit, that's just all completely nonsensical and makes no sense. Fucking reality benders...\c-
