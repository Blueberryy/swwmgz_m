The **Demolitionist Library** is what you're currently reading. This internal database will provide you with additional information on obtained items during your mission, along with related information on various people and organizations, or interesting bits of lore. The library is updated automatically with each item you obtain and each additional entry you read, based on their related information, so be sure to check it out once in a while, if you feel like having a nice read. This is especially important for the various items you can use, or your weapons, as the entries for them will instruct you on how to adequately operate them.

Please note that the quality of articles may vary, depending entirely on how motivated the editor (**Taro**) or the lead writer (**Saya**) felt when writing them. Additional language options are available thanks to community contributors, plus an official Spanish localization handled by **Akari Labs**' very own professional translator, **Ana Blanco**.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfOh yeah, you can also find notes like this one here in a couple articles if I feel like saying something extra that doesn't "fit the tone" of the whole thing, I guess.\c-

\cfOh and by the way, many thanks to Ana-san for the Spanish translation. I couldn't resist, because really, she was so happy to do it and she's so cute... She told me that it's really funny how all my ramblings sound in her language, huhu.\c-
