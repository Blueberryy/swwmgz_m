Full Name: Zanaveth Nekuraku III
Codename: "The Corruptor"
Nationality: Nukuri
Date Of Birth: 2042-08-20

Summary: Zanaveth III is the sole daughter of Misa Unissix and Zanaveth II. She had a quite troubled childhood, suffering bullying for years due to her odd personality and mannerisms. After graduating from the University of Nos-Kora in 2140, she went on to pursue her lifelong goal of "taking over the world".

Addendum: Zanaveth's negative world view and hostile attitude towards other people could be seen as a direct consequence of her experiences growing up. She rarely opens up to anyone, except her own parents, and also Saya, due to the time they've spent together.

Saya's Note: Zana-chan may look all cold and stuff but under all of that she's very emotional, real sensitive. I remember when I had to take care of her and every time she got in trouble, she'd come to me all flustered and angry, and I'd offer a shoulder to cry on, some nice headpats and hugs, and she'd calm down. It was... honestly heartwarming, made me feel like a mom, in a way. I wonder what she's up to now, I haven't seen her since that fucking "White Scar" bullshit happened. Ahhhh... Damn it... I miss petting that soft and fluffy hair of hers...

Summary: Zanaveth III is the sole daughter of Misa Unissix and Zanaveth II. She had a quite troubled childhood, suffering bullying for years due to her odd personality and mannerisms. After graduating from the University of Nos-Kora in 2140, she went on to pursue her lifelong goal of "taking over the world". She attempted to take control of Earth during the period of confusion following the demon invasion of 2148, but failed.

Addendum: Zanaveth's negative world view and hostile attitude towards other people could be seen as a direct consequence of her experiences growing up. She rarely opens up to anyone, except her own parents, and also Saya, due to the time they've spent together.

Saya's Note: Zana-chan may look all cold and stuff but under all of that she's very emotional, real sensitive. I feel like I've become some sort of third mom to her. You know, it caught me by surprise, when I heard that out of nowhere she was back on Earth, managed to sneak in somehow. The big dummy got herself in trouble once again and just ran for our house, scared the shit out of me, but there it was, once again, that wonderful experience I missed of petting her soft fluffy hair, recomforting her after yet another fuckup... It's a shame that she had to leave afterwards, but at least we spent some quality time together. Still, it was nice to "give her a hand", huhuhuhu...
