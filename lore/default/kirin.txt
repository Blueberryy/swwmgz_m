Full Name: Kirin Xanai, Child Emperor of the Great Rust Empire
Nationality: Akkouxhei
Date Of Birth: 2080-04-13

Summary: Kirin Xanai is the current head of the Rust Empire of Akkou, one of the many offshoots of the Empire of Novoskhana who branched off in protest of the Eternal Empress's aggressive policies. He is a very down-to-earth leader and sees himself as "just like any other guy". The previously struggling land of Akkou has faced great prosperity since the Rust Empire was formed, with the Xanai family being seen as a blessing from the gods. Kirin is very fond of making friends with people, and is absolutely adorable.

Addendum: Due to being from one of the major branches of Anarukon royalty, his engagement to Saya Miyamoto (â™¥) opened up many opportunities for an alliance with humans, and served to heal the wounds previously caused by Imanaki Corp's intrusions.

Saya's Note: Ahhh... Kirin-kun, you're so cute~... You make me the happiest girl in the world!!!
