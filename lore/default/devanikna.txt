Name: Devanikna
Classification: Land of warriors
Location: Ixxeney, Xathar system

Summary: The Devanikan are a race of fierce warriors, said to descend from dragons (in their language, "Devanikan" means "Dragonblood"). They are divided in several clans, with one of them, the Unissix, leading the others.

Addendum: These people are fond of adventuring and slaying beasts, many clan members having quite a lot of tales to tell of their exploits. Deneva Unissix, older sister of Misa Unissix, is currently one of the most well known warriors, having been the one to finally defeat Mero The Destructor, a mighty, hulking golem built by the Shadow Prince Kuro Noroko who for centuries had spread terror across Ixxeney.

Saya's Note: Misa's people are cool af. They kinda make me think of this one old JRPG series I played many many years ago, it had to do with people of dragon blood too... uh... forgot what it was called... oh well. Cool Dragon warriors, fuck yeah.
