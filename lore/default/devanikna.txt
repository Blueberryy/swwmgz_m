**Devanikna** is one of the two major nations of **Ixxeney**, the largest planet in the **Zenna system**. It is home to a humanoid race known as the **Devanikan**, fierce warriors who legends say were brought upon this world by an entity known as the **Ancestor Dragon**, which they worship as their god. In their tongue, the name of "Devanikan" means "Dragonblood".

Devanikan society is mainly divided in several clans, many of them dating back thousands of years. Currently, the **Unissix clan** holds the leadership of the whole nation, having been unanimously chosen by the rest of the population following their defeat of the crazed **Lord Ni'Kai**, of the rival **Devenko clan**, who had previously taken over by force and instated a totalitarian government.

One of the most notable aspects of the Devanikan race is that fully trained warriors have the ability to transform themselves into dragons. This transformation is entirely magical in nature, as their dragon forms appear to be projections, rather than fully physical bodies. Once in this form, their strength is greatly boosted, and they become more potent conduits for spellcasting, thus giving them the upper hand in most fights. It is, however, quite straining to their bodies, so it's something they only use in exceptional cases.

The land of Devanikna itself is divided in several cities, most covering the broad forest areas surrounding the Noxan sea, where the capital city of **Dekhasa** is located. The capital is a very popular tourist spot due to its particular geography: massive spires of rock springing forth from the depths, often reaching up to 11 kilometers above sea level. The Devanikan built their homes along the walls of these spires, and pride themselves in the quite impressive durability and stability of their architectural work.

Among the many clans, there are quite a number of "heroes of legend" documented. Warriors whose feats are known and praised by all. Of note are people such as **Deva Unissix**, son of the clan's founding father, and the one who led his comrades in battle against Ni'Kai, or his granddaughter **Deneva Unissix**, who singlehandedly defeated the mighty golem **Mero The Destructor**, who for centuries had spread terror across Ixxeney, having even been seen as unbeatable by the powerful titans of the neighbouring nation of **Xekke**.

Lesser known facts about the Devanikan include their strong defense of racial purity. When princess **Devai Unissix**, current head of the clan, announced her marriage to **Serwand Nerukousei**, a chimera constructed by a wandering archwizard, he started receiving threats from the population, calling him a "beast in man's form" and accusing him of corrupting the Unissix bloodline as a means to take control of their nation. These threats extended towards their own children too, who were denoted as "crossbred abominations" of mixed Devanikan and chimeric blood. It wasn't until Deneva's first major achievements as a warrior that the persecution they faced eventually stopped. Ever since then, the hostility they faced has been gradually fading, as newer generations became much more accepting of race mixing.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
\cfYeah, Misa's people are cool af. Well, excluding the whole racism part. That's a load of fucking shit, for sure. I heard from Zana-sama that if she hadn't met Misa back then, she would have probably taken her own life from all of that she went through. Fuck... But at least, she's living happily with Zana-sama (lucky devil), and yeah, things are getting better in there now at least.\c-

\cfYou know, all this stuff, it reminds me of this one old JRPG series I played many many years ago, that was also all about people of dragon blood too... can't even remember what it was called, though. Heck, I even had Misa play it once and she kept talking about all the parallels and shit. Oh well, cool dragon warriors, fuck yeah.\c-
