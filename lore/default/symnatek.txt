**Symnatek** was founded in 2040 by **Joanna Josephson**, initially acting as a local manufacturer of adopted **Nukuri** technology (mainly for industrial purposes). Its nature was additionally signified by choosing a Nukuribaku name for itself: "Symnaki Tekkanosei" (Alliance Creations). In less than a year it became the dominant force in industrial manufacturing within its home country.

Following **World War 3**, and with the **White Scar Treaty** in effect, the company was forced to abandon its usage of Nukuri technology, which pretty much meant closing its doors completely. Rather than give up, they decided to simply have a "change of direction", dedicating themselves to technology of human origin instead (going against their very founding principles). As an aside, to better compensate for any potential losses in this shift, the child company of **Itamex** was also founded, serving as a provider of supplies for the military.

As of this article's writing, Symnatek remains king in its home turf, managing even to fend off the almost-global domination of **Mixom**, making Australia one of the few countries where they have any real competition.

\cxSaya's Notes:\c-
