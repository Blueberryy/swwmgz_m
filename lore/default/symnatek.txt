Name: Symnatek
Classification: Industrial Equipment Manufacturer
Location: Brisbane, Australia

Summary: "Building a better world for a better future, since 2040". The largest producer of industrial equipment in its home country. While the main body dedicates itself to industry and construction, the child company of Itamex provides the military with all sorts of basic supplies.

Addendum: Symnatek is large enough to fend off the almost-global domination of Mixom, makin Australia one of the few countries where they have any real competition.

Saya's Note: In this time and age, even fucking tool makers contribute to the military. Huh? What do you mean "the pot calling the kettle black"? Oh sure, just because of Ibuki that makes me one of them. Whatever.
